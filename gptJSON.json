1 - 0 - with the drafting programs i use this is a really nice product

1 - 1 - Had it for a couple weeks and its almost as good as my previous iteration of this same mouse from logitech. I say almost because this one doesnt sit as comfortably as my older one but its not too bad

1 - 2 - Love this product; it connects instantly and is customizable to your needs in terms of the what you want buttons to execute. I should have bought this years ago; but it is a bit pricey. I would definitely recommend this product.

1 - 3 - The feel is great. I like color. Clicking from left right is smooth.

1 - 4 - The best mouse ever!!! I love this mouse and I’m a Designer so I was very careful in looking for my next mouse and this is a must buy!

1 - 5 - Best invention ever!  Instead of using a separate mouse for my Mac and then plug in and unplug the usb to interchange between my home laptop and work laptop to use the mouse, this makes life so much easier.  I can interchange from my Mac to my home laptop and work laptop with a simple press of a button.  I highly recommend!!!

1 - 6 - Works great and quick for what I need.  After buying the Vertical ergonomic mouse for work, I feel the Vertical fits my hand better and there is less strain.  More expensive than vertical also.

1 - 7 - Comfortable. Quiet. Smooth. Impressive.There were two issues 1) quality control seems to be a bit of a problem. I ordered two of them and one was noticeably smoother than the other and just performed better. I d recommend that if you receive it and you like it but it feels like its just short of perfect then exchange it for another. You just might get one that works perfectly. 2) AVOID THE WHITE MODEL AT ALL COSTS. It changes to yellow after a few uses. Others have made the same comments. It seems to be an ongoing issue which reflects badly on this company that they would continue to distribute it. In any case, the white looks amazing but I am telling you... you need to avoid it anyway. It s really too bad because it was very sharp looking.

1 - 8 - Need a big grip? wanna free a USB port and connect via Bluetooth, wanna be able to add and edit features, customize buttons, look no more, this is it.

1 - 9 - The title says it all. My job software has a lot of drop down menus and boxes to click. The mouse is accurate and the click is soft and quiet. When your clicking a lot with a mouse that noise becomes very annoying.

1 - 10 - This mouse is the bee s knees. I d recommend this device 10/10.

1 - 11 - This mouse is like having three mice in one.  It has a preset button underneath it and allows you to change PCs at the touch of a button.  If desired, the mouse has a lot of configurable options via the Logitech software that you can download from their site for free.  It is not required for the mouse to work but it s there if you want to configure it to its fullest extent.

1 - 12 - The scroll wheel on this mouse is far and away the best I ve ever used, and I use the horizontal scroll wheel far more than i thought I would. My only complaints are there s not a spot to store the USB receiver in the mouse (not a huge deal since it can connect to 3 Bluetooth devices) and the mouse has no onboard memory. The lack of onboard memory is the bigger issue, as I can t install the Options+ app on my work PC, meaning I am unable to take full advantage of the mouse on the PC where the customizability would be most useful. But even without onboard memory this is my favorite mouse I ve used and I decided to keep it over the likes of the Logitech G604, Razer Basilisk, and JLab Epic Mouse.

1 - 13 - Mouse is great. Ergonomics are well designed and feel good. Connection is solid and fast (coming from usijg only gaming mice) but the issue is, the software slows the side scrolling down. Not sure why but when i delete the software the side scrolling returns to its smooth former self. With the software, side scrolling feels clunky and choppy. Such a bummer because you miss out on so many great perks of the software. Get the mouse, dont download the software.

1 - 14 - The best all-around mouse currently. Great for work, productivity, and just about everything. Not a top of the line mouse for gaming, but not bad. Overall, the best mouse on the market currently.

2 - 0 - Great Mouse. comfortable, fast and smooth. My only complain, if this counts as one, I will soon need to upgrade my current Logitech keyboard to one that accepts the Logi Bolt receiver. As of now those keyboards a very expensive.

2 - 1 - For context: I m 6 4, large hands, and I use claw grip.I love how this fits my hand even though I use claw grip.  The setup was fairly simple, I had a few questions but the  buddy  software it launches during setup helped a lot.  At base level this mouse is already awesome, but where it shines is the customization with the logitech software it launches, everything from custom button mapping, sensitivity, speed, gesture+button combinations - it s really great.  Switching between sources is seamless as well.  Definitely a great buy!

2 - 2 - I have fairly large hands and this mouse is the most comfortable one to use with the added advantage that I can switch from my desktop to laptop with the touch of one button. You can use bluetooth direct to your device or through the dongle included

2 - 3 - Ergonomic, fast, comfortable and easy connect to multiple devices

2 - 4 - Fantastic mouse with the best handling precision and control I’ve ever experienced with a mouse. If you are a creative you must never skimp on your mouse. I highly recommend this one.

2 - 5 - Great mouse, very comfortable.  Multi computer support works great and easy to use.  Got this with MX Keys Keyboard and switching between 3 computers is a breeze.

2 - 6 - Very nice. Similar to my Microsoft precision mouse but with the added benefit of Flow to switch between machines with the same mouse.

2 - 7 - I have had this and its predecessor, both of which are very good mice. This isn t built for gaming however the eye on it very rarely has issues which I find to be quite good. The clicks and scrolling are very smooth.

2 - 8 - Being a spreadsheet guru and needing a quick mouse this things is perfect

2 - 9 - Switched from the wireless RAZER BASILISK mouse that will no longer hold a charge after only a year of ownership and I’ll never go back. I’ve owned Logitech mice in the past and they have only gotten better over the years.

2 - 10 - Game changer .. this mouse have been very, very smooth, and effective comfortable than all other mouse that I have used before ..￼this is the best

2 - 11 - This mouse is fearure rich and can be customized across varying applications both in standard productivity programs as well as customized for gaming. Even works directly on glass!

2 - 12 - Its smooth, its ergonomic is awesome - i would refer my fnds

2 - 13 - As an old hand, I like my mouse to click, but the best buy here was out of the MX Master 3, so I bought the 3s - no click. The largest issue I have with the mouse is the inconsistent scroll wheel. Yes, you can scroll VERY fast, but not very accurately. All in all good mouse, but frustrating...

2 - 14 - Pricy but it’s worth it!  Absolutely love this and the Mx keys to go with it.

List of reviews: 

3 - 0 - This mouse by Logitech is great!! I purchased this a few weeks ago and I love it. Very easy to operate and I hooked it up to Bluetooth on my land line computer.

3 - 1 - The best mouse I have ever owned. I would recommend this mose to anyone and yes it will work on your Mac.

3 - 2 - I really like the side scroll function and the extra buttons come in handy

3 - 3 - Works very well! I really appreciate the slot to rest your thumb. Probably overkill for what I will use it for, but I enjoy it!

3 - 4 - Great mouse!!  Great resolution, smooth, very nice options.

3 - 5 - I was wondering how I would enjoy a slightly angled mouse after using normal mice for my entire life.It s comfortable, smooth and very nice on the wrist. The sideways scroll is invaluable for spreadsheets or Netflix [or any other interface with a side scroll].Every button and scroll on this thing is programable. Battery life is great and it has a  heft  to it that lets you know its constructed well without making it difficult to push around a desk. I bought a second one for work. I wonder how the soft touch material will hold up over time but I m still very happy with this mouse.

3 - 6 - An excellent mouse.  It took a bit to get used to the back button being below where my thumb was normally placed but I m happy.

3 - 7 - Best mouse I ve ever used. No need for AA/AAA batteries as this mouse recharges via USB. The change lasts a very long time (at least several weeks of daily work and personal use). I have no regrets spending $100 on a mouse. I also like the tactile feel of the mouse buttons and the lack of the traditional clicking noise of button presses.

3 - 8 - Background:  I ve been using this line of mice since the MX Revolution.  They have been, prior to the Master 3/3S, by far my favorite mice.Unfortunately, with the 3 and 3S Logitech changed the shape of the mouse.  The curve that supports your palm is no longer a smooth arc, but instead is more sharply curved where the new (useless) power LED is.  That has caused me some significant hand stiffness and has rendered the mouse useless to me.It still has the smooth scroll wheel and other features, sure, but they re of no use if I can t use the mouse comfortably.  Fortunately there seem to be a lot of Master 2S mice floating around for sale.

3 - 9 - Overall it is a great mouse. Sometimes I have connection and lagging issues but not too bad.

3 - 10 - Awesome mouse.  Very ergonomic and aesthetically pleasing.  It is very comfortable to use

3 - 11 - Wow, just wonderful!  That s it.  Nothing else to say.

3 - 12 - I’ve been uaing the mouse for quite a while and I have to say i love it. Some people talked about the weight in reviews saying its a bit heavy but it isn’t. Its perfect.

3 - 13 - It s a well built mouse with great features like the ultrafast scrolling wheel and the side scrolling thumb wheel.  My main gripe is that it is too big for my hands and can recommend this for people with small hands.

3 - 14 - I recently purchased the Logitech MX master 3S mouse and it has been an absolute experience. The wireless laser mouse is incredibly accurate and responsive, while the ultrafast scrolling feature makes navigating through websites a breeze. I m also a huge fan of its ergonomic design, which fits nicely in my hand. The Logitech MX Mouse is definitely worth every penny!

List of reviews: 

4 - 0 - Very comfortable on hands, provides a comfy grip.  I love it! I heard lots of good reviews about it & so I decided to buy one for myself.

4 - 1 - The scrolling is smooth and effective and the side scroll comes in handy. Ergonomics of this mouse is great too. Perfect for anyone who works in excel a lot.

4 - 2 - Good product I used one before similar to this. I would recommend this to anyone

4 - 3 - A great and simple mouse! Recommend it more for an office or hobbyist setting, as it lacks a bunch of extra buttons for gaming. That being said, the Logi Options+ Software lets you rebind most of the extra buttons, even the Horizontal Scroll Wheel. A good bit of extra flexibility goes a long way. The mouse is slightly heavier than most Logitech thanks to the built-in rechargeable battery via USB-C, but it is easy to get used to. The device comes with a Dongle for quick connection, but also has Bluetooth access. Up to 3 devices can be stored for quick switching. Additionally, the Logi Options+ can utilize Logi Flow to allow you to quickly change between multiple devices by simply dragging to a screen s edge, much like a Multiple Display setup.

4 - 4 - I can t find anything wrong with this mouse. It s very ergonomic, responsive, fast and I love the side wheel which I ve programmed for zoom function. The reason I wanted a laser, rather than optical, mouse is so that it will work on almost any surface, including my glass desk top.

4 - 5 - Everything about this mouse is fantastic, but it loses points to me because its full functionality is dependent on installing the Logi Options+ application. I use this mouse both on my work and personal computers and I can t install outside applications on my work computer so it isn t as good in that regard. Other than that, this mouse is outstanding

4 - 6 - This mouse has been the best mouse for productivity. Super smooth and thr click of the mouse is almost silent.

4 - 7 - Used this mouse for custom build, mouse works great and is very comfortable.

4 - 8 - This is my second MX mouse. Amazing and veey productive while switching between laptos. Also no need of that irritating usb dongle.

4 - 9 - Love the ergonomically and texture, smooth fast and reliable. Bast miles are you so far?

4 - 10 - This mouse was beyond disappointing for a price tag of 100$ and targeted at professionals. The scrolling was cheap and ruined the smooth-scrolling experience you get from the built-in trackpad. Specifically, inside Code editors, this mouse was scrolling way too fast, to a point where it was unusable. 15$ mouse does a better job than this. Though there were options provided in Logi + app, I needed help. Finally, I installed a third-party app to bring a smooth scrolling experience. I wish I could return this. If you are in the market for a mouse, you would be better off with other cheaper mice. Do not give in to the hype around this product! Period!

4 - 11 - I loved this mouse. I only went to the G604 because I got it on sale for a third of the price and it had most of the features I wanted. This mouse is incredible.

4 - 12 - This mouse is amazing! I was using the magic trackpad for years and switching to this i will never go back.

4 - 13 - Using the MX Master 3S does give the work experience a more premium feel than your average mouse. Bulkiness might not be for everyone.

4 - 14 - Works seamlessly with my Apple desktop with no problem.

5 - 0 - Easy to set up. Accurate. Long battery life. Quality materials.

5 - 1 - Great mouse. Really like the quiet click more than I thought I would. That is a great feature in an office environment. All of the customizations for the mouse are fantastic.

5 - 2 - Good mouse and worth of buying with ergonomics feature.

5 - 3 - Love the silent clicks and feel. The buttons are also highly customizable. Just wish that it didn t cost as much, or that a silent version of the M720 or M705 were also available.

5 - 4 - Purchased this to pair with my Mac Mini since it didn’t come with a mouse. Love the ergonomic design. Not too big for my kids to use either.  Very responsive. Maybe too sensitive at times.

5 - 5 - Excellent.  I use it for gaming.  It fits my palm very well...

5 - 6 - Mouse is very high quality and precise. Good customization options and battery life before charging is excellent.

5 - 7 - Best mouse i have bought so far. Smooth and accurate

5 - 8 - NOT FOR ME............................................

5 - 9 - Absolutely the best wireless mouse I ve ever owned.  The tactile feel is smooth and quiet.  I wonder how much more responsiveness is even possible!  The best wireless mouse going today.

5 - 10 - Great mouse to take to and from the office. Could not recommend more.

5 - 11 - Great mouse... handles up to 3 devices.  Very comfortable and responsive

5 - 12 - Outstanding device with exceptional long term quality.

5 - 13 - Most comfortable and smoothest mouse I have ever used. Love this enough that I bought more than one. Easy, comfortable with larger sized hands and been reliable on multiple surfaces. Great mouse!

5 - 14 - For a work mouse, it checks all the boxes. Asfor the app to change the settings, pressets are a little funky but can custimize and get working.
