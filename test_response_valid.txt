string(127) "Great mouse.  It is comfortable to use and responsive.  I previously used the Apple mouse, and found this to be an improvement."


string(56) "Excellent mouse, best one I’ve ever owned in 40 years!"


string(56) "Never had a mouse like this before, so glad I bought it."


string(377) "I normally don't write reviews but this mouse is SO amazing I figured I would.  The speed scroll is awesome, makes moving through large spreadsheet so much faster but allows to slow it down if you don't need that feature.  The side scrolling adds a whole other dimension of efficiency of time to my work day.  There is a big ROI with the cost of this mouse.  Worth every penny!"


string(59) "So smooth way better than the Magic Mouse I’ve been using"


string(62) "with the drafting programs i use this is a really nice product"


string(199) "Had it for a couple weeks and its almost as good as my previous iteration of this same mouse from logitech. I say almost because this one doesnt sit as comfortably as my older one but its not too bad"


string(228) "Love this product; it connects instantly and is customizable to your needs in terms of the what you want buttons to execute. I should have bought this years ago; but it is a bit pricey. I would definitely recommend this product."


string(68) "The feel is great. I like color. Clicking from left right is smooth."


string(136) "The best mouse ever!!! I love this mouse and I’m a Designer so I was very careful in looking for my next mouse and this is a must buy!"


string(327) "Best invention ever!  Instead of using a separate mouse for my Mac and then plug in and unplug the usb to interchange between my home laptop and work laptop to use the mouse, this makes life so much easier.  I can interchange from my Mac to my home laptop and work laptop with a simple press of a button.  I highly recommend!!!"


string(193) "Works great and quick for what I need.  After buying the Vertical ergonomic mouse for work, I feel the Vertical fits my hand better and there is less strain.  More expensive than vertical also."


string(754) "Comfortable. Quiet. Smooth. Impressive.

There were two issues 1) quality control seems to be a bit of a problem. I ordered two of them and one was noticeably smoother than the other and just performed better. I'd recommend that if you receive it and you like it but it feels like its just short of perfect then exchange it for another. You just might get one that works perfectly. 

2) AVOID THE WHITE MODEL AT ALL COSTS. It changes to yellow after a few uses. Others have made the same comments. It seems to be an ongoing issue which reflects badly on this company that they would continue to distribute it. In any case, the white looks amazing but I am telling you... you need to avoid it anyway. It's really too bad because it was very sharp looking."


string(150) "Need a big grip? wanna free a USB port and connect via Bluetooth, wanna be able to add and edit features, customize buttons, look no more, this is it."


string(214) "The title says it all. My job software has a lot of drop down menus and boxes to click. The mouse is accurate and the click is soft and quiet. When your clicking a lot with a mouse that noise becomes very annoying."


string(63) "This mouse is the bee's knees. I'd recommend this device 10/10."


string(378) "This mouse is like having three mice in one.  It has a preset button underneath it and allows you to change PCs at the touch of a button.  

If desired, the mouse has a lot of configurable options via the Logitech software that you can download from their site for free.  It is not required for the mouse to work but it's there if you want to configure it to its fullest extent."


string(702) "The scroll wheel on this mouse is far and away the best I've ever used, and I use the horizontal scroll wheel far more than i thought I would. My only complaints are there's not a spot to store the USB receiver in the mouse (not a huge deal since it can connect to 3 Bluetooth devices) and the mouse has no onboard memory. The lack of onboard memory is the bigger issue, as I can't install the Options+ app on my work PC, meaning I am unable to take full advantage of the mouse on the PC where the customizability would be most useful. But even without onboard memory this is my favorite mouse I've used and I decided to keep it over the likes of the Logitech G604, Razer Basilisk, and JLab Epic Mouse."


string(462) "Mouse is great. Ergonomics are well designed and feel good. Connection is solid and fast (coming from usijg only gaming mice) but the issue is, the software slows the side scrolling down. Not sure why but when i delete the software the side scrolling returns to its smooth former self. With the software, side scrolling feels clunky and choppy. Such a bummer because you miss out on so many great perks of the software. Get the mouse, dont download the software."


string(195) "The best all-around mouse currently. Great for work, productivity, and just about everything. Not a top of the line mouse for gaming, but not bad. Overall, the best mouse on the market currently."


string(51) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 2"


string(228) "Great Mouse. comfortable, fast and smooth. My only complain, if this counts as one, I will soon need to upgrade my current Logitech keyboard to one that accepts the Logi Bolt receiver. As of now those keyboards a very expensive."


string(538) "For context: I'm 6'4, large hands, and I use claw grip.

I love how this fits my hand even though I use claw grip.  The setup was fairly simple, I had a few questions but the "buddy" software it launches during setup helped a lot.  At base level this mouse is already awesome, but where it shines is the customization with the logitech software it launches, everything from custom button mapping, sensitivity, speed, gesture+button combinations - it's really great.  Switching between sources is seamless as well.  Definitely a great buy!"


string(249) "I have fairly large hands and this mouse is the most comfortable one to use with the added advantage that I can switch from my desktop to laptop with the touch of one button. You can use bluetooth direct to your device or through the dongle included"


string(65) "Ergonomic, fast, comfortable and easy connect to multiple devices"


string(185) "Fantastic mouse with the best handling precision and control I’ve ever experienced with a mouse. If you are a creative you must never skimp on your mouse. I highly recommend this one."


string(162) "Great mouse, very comfortable.  Multi computer support works great and easy to use.  Got this with MX Keys Keyboard and switching between 3 computers is a breeze."


string(133) "Very nice. Similar to my Microsoft precision mouse but with the added benefit of Flow to switch between machines with the same mouse."


string(216) "I have had this and its predecessor, both of which are very good mice. This isn't built for gaming however the eye on it very rarely has issues which I find to be quite good. The clicks and scrolling are very smooth."


string(73) "Being a spreadsheet guru and needing a quick mouse this things is perfect"


string(226) "Switched from the wireless RAZER BASILISK mouse that will no longer hold a charge after only a year of ownership and I’ll never go back. I’ve owned Logitech mice in the past and they have only gotten better over the years."


string(148) "Game changer .. this mouse have been very, very smooth, and effective comfortable than all other mouse that I have used before ..￼this is the best"


string(179) "This mouse is fearure rich and can be customized across varying applications both in standard productivity programs as well as customized for gaming. Even works directly on glass!"


string(60) "Its smooth, its ergonomic is awesome - i would refer my fnds"


string(294) "As an old hand, I like my mouse to click, but the best buy here was out of the MX Master 3, so I bought the 3s - no click. The largest issue I have with the mouse is the inconsistent scroll wheel. Yes, you can scroll VERY fast, but not very accurately. All in all good mouse, but frustrating..."


string(79) "Pricy but it’s worth it!  Absolutely love this and the Mx keys to go with it."


string(160) "This mouse by Logitech is great!! I purchased this a few weeks ago and I love it. Very easy to operate and I hooked it up to Bluetooth on my land line computer."


string(105) "The best mouse I have ever owned. I would recommend this mose to anyone and yes it will work on your Mac."


string(74) "I really like the side scroll function and the extra buttons come in handy"


string(127) "Works very well! I really appreciate the slot to rest your thumb. Probably overkill for what I will use it for, but I enjoy it!"


string(59) "Great mouse!!  Great resolution, smooth, very nice options."


string(51) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 3"


string(594) "I was wondering how I would enjoy a slightly angled mouse after using normal mice for my entire life.

It's comfortable, smooth and very nice on the wrist. The sideways scroll is invaluable for spreadsheets or Netflix [or any other interface with a side scroll].

Every button and scroll on this thing is programable. Battery life is great and it has a "heft" to it that lets you know its constructed well without making it difficult to push around a desk. 

I bought a second one for work. 

I wonder how the soft touch material will hold up over time but I'm still very happy with this mouse."


string(127) "An excellent mouse.  It took a bit to get used to the back button being below where my thumb was normally placed but I'm happy."


string(339) "Best mouse I've ever used. No need for AA/AAA batteries as this mouse recharges via USB. The change lasts a very long time (at least several weeks of daily work and personal use). I have no regrets spending $100 on a mouse. I also like the tactile feel of the mouse buttons and the lack of the traditional clicking noise of button presses."


string(647) "Background:  I've been using this line of mice since the MX Revolution.  They have been, prior to the Master 3/3S, by far my favorite mice.

Unfortunately, with the 3 and 3S Logitech changed the shape of the mouse.  The curve that supports your palm is no longer a smooth arc, but instead is more sharply curved where the new (useless) power LED is.  That has caused me some significant hand stiffness and has rendered the mouse useless to me.

It still has the smooth scroll wheel and other features, sure, but they're of no use if I can't use the mouse comfortably.  Fortunately there seem to be a lot of Master 2S mice floating around for sale."


string(92) "Overall it is a great mouse. Sometimes I have connection and lagging issues but not too bad."


string(89) "Awesome mouse.  Very ergonomic and aesthetically pleasing.  It is very comfortable to use"


string(54) "Wow, just wonderful!  That's it.  Nothing else to say."


string(173) "I’ve been uaing the mouse for quite a while and I have to say i love it. Some people talked about the weight in reviews saying its a bit heavy but it isn’t. Its perfect."


string(216) "It's a well built mouse with great features like the ultrafast scrolling wheel and the side scrolling thumb wheel.  My main gripe is that it is too big for my hands and can recommend this for people with small hands."


string(368) "I recently purchased the Logitech MX master 3S mouse and it has been an absolute experience. The wireless laser mouse is incredibly accurate and responsive, while the ultrafast scrolling feature makes navigating through websites a breeze. I'm also a huge fan of its ergonomic design, which fits nicely in my hand. The Logitech MX Mouse is definitely worth every penny!"


string(137) "Very comfortable on hands, provides a comfy grip.  I love it! I heard lots of good reviews about it & so I decided to buy one for myself."


string(157) "The scrolling is smooth and effective and the side scroll comes in handy. Ergonomics of this mouse is great too. Perfect for anyone who works in excel a lot."


string(81) "Good product
 I used one before similar to this. I would recommend this to anyone"


string(756) "A great and simple mouse! Recommend it more for an office or hobbyist setting, as it lacks a bunch of extra buttons for gaming. That being said, the Logi Options+ Software lets you rebind most of the extra buttons, even the Horizontal Scroll Wheel. A good bit of extra flexibility goes a long way. 

The mouse is slightly heavier than most Logitech thanks to the built-in rechargeable battery via USB-C, but it is easy to get used to. 

The device comes with a Dongle for quick connection, but also has Bluetooth access. Up to 3 devices can be stored for quick switching. Additionally, the Logi Options+ can utilize Logi Flow to allow you to quickly change between multiple devices by simply dragging to a screen's edge, much like a Multiple Display setup."


string(281) "I can't find anything wrong with this mouse. It's very ergonomic, responsive, fast and I love the side wheel which I've programmed for zoom function. The reason I wanted a laser, rather than optical, mouse is so that it will work on almost any surface, including my glass desk top."


string(352) "Everything about this mouse is fantastic, but it loses points to me because its full functionality is dependent on installing the Logi Options+ application. I use this mouse both on my work and personal computers and I can't install outside applications on my work computer so it isn't as good in that regard. Other than that, this mouse is outstanding"


string(110) "This mouse has been the best mouse for productivity. Super smooth and thr click of the mouse is almost silent."


string(76) "Used this mouse for custom build, mouse works great and is very comfortable."


string(131) "This is my second MX mouse. Amazing and veey productive while switching between laptos. Also no need of that irritating usb dongle."


string(88) "Love the ergonomically and texture, smooth fast and reliable. Bast miles are you so far?"


string(51) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 4"


string(655) "This mouse was beyond disappointing for a price tag of 100$ and targeted at professionals. The scrolling was cheap and ruined the smooth-scrolling experience you get from the built-in trackpad. Specifically, inside Code editors, this mouse was scrolling way too fast, to a point where it was unusable. 15$ mouse does a better job than this. Though there were options provided in Logi + app, I needed help. Finally, I installed a third-party app to bring a smooth scrolling experience. I wish I could return this. If you are in the market for a mouse, you would be better off with other cheaper mice. Do not give in to the hype around this product! Period!"


string(161) "I loved this mouse. I only went to the G604 because I got it on sale for a third of the price and it had most of the features I wanted. This mouse is incredible."


string(107) "This mouse is amazing! I was using the magic trackpad for years and switching to this i will never go back."


string(134) "Using the MX Master 3S does give the work experience a more premium feel than your average mouse. Bulkiness might not be for everyone."


string(55) "Works seamlessly with my Apple desktop with no problem."


string(63) "Easy to set up. Accurate. Long battery life. Quality materials."


string(174) "Great mouse. Really like the quiet click more than I thought I would. That is a great feature in an office environment. All of the customizations for the mouse are fantastic."


string(55) "Good mouse and worth of buying with ergonomics feature."


string(179) "Love the silent clicks and feel. The buttons are also highly customizable. Just wish that it didn't cost as much, or that a silent version of the M720 or M705 were also available."


string(190) "Purchased this to pair with my Mac Mini since it didn’t come with a mouse. Love the ergonomic design. Not too big for my kids to use either.  Very responsive. Maybe too sensitive at times."


string(62) "Excellent.  I use it for gaming.  It fits my palm very well..."


string(113) "Mouse is very high quality and precise. Good customization options and battery life before charging is excellent."


string(52) "Best mouse i have bought so far. Smooth and accurate"


string(54) "NOT FOR ME............................................"


string(185) "Absolutely the best wireless mouse I've ever owned.  The tactile feel is smooth and quiet.  I wonder how much more responsiveness is even possible!  The best wireless mouse going today."


string(69) "Great mouse to take to and from the office. Could not recommend more."


string(72) "Great mouse... handles up to 3 devices.  Very comfortable and responsive"


string(54) "Outstanding device with exceptional long term quality."


string(195) "Most comfortable and smoothest mouse I have ever used. Love this enough that I bought more than one. Easy, comfortable with larger sized hands and been reliable on multiple surfaces. Great mouse!"


string(143) "For a work mouse, it checks all the boxes. Asfor the app to change the settings, pressets are a little funky but can custimize and get working."


string(51) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 5"


string(195) "Good side scrolling and fast scrolling, adjustable quick actions are easy to pick up on and can be changed for different applications. Had it for two years and the battery still runs like a champ"


string(660) "It's a great mouse! It works with Windows and Mac. I initially bought the MX Master 3S for the Mac butI exchanged it for this one. The only difference between the two is the color scheme and accessories. I preferred the dongle over the USB C cable.I have many cables. I use the dongle on my older Windows desktop and bluetooth on my MacBook. I have no issues with its usability. It has a feature called Flow where you can interchangeably use on the Mac and a Windows PC exchanging images and files back and forth while using both at the same time. Tracking and movement is nice as well. It's very customizable with the Logi software. It's perfect for my needs."


string(217) "I bought this for my wife to use at work, and I regularly get texts throughout the telling how well it's working for her. She predominantly works in Excel, and the dedicated side scrolling wheel has been a life saver."


string(90) "I use it for gaming office and daily use. Its a good fit for all. But it is actually hugep"


string(58) "Really good to use, wish it was a bit larger for my hands."


string(241) "Its quiet as a mouse! If youre in the market for a productivity mouse to speed up your day to day processes, give this a try. It has a reputation for a reason. Upgrading from the 3 gave a more refined build thats quiet for the office setting"


string(201) "Hands down the best mouse on the market. I have purchased over 20 of these for my office.. cant go wrong! I have all my desks paired with the Logitech K780 also the best KB on the market in my opinion!"


string(163) "One mouse that you will cherish, and will do more than you expect a regular mouse to do. The extra set of buttons that can be customized, increase your efficiency."


string(173) "Best mouse that I have ever used. I try other brands but always ending up going back to Logitech devices. The only brand that I will use for mouse and keyboards from now on."


string(124) "Works great switching between two laptops.  Have not had any issues with inteference as you would with basic wireless mouse."


string(95) "I loved the MX Master 2S and had to get the 3S. It didnt disappoint and it is incredibly quiet."


string(82) "I don't use it for gaming but for work.  I like the speed and how it fits my hand."


string(368) "I absolutely love this mouse. At $99 I was a little hesitant to buy it but it stays flawlessly connected via Bluetooth which was a big problem with outher mice that use dingles for me. Feels amazing in my hand with lots of buttons in perfect spots that are fully customizable and can even do different functions in different apps. Cannot recommend this product enough."


string(131) "Best mouse I ever used. Super quite, smooth and responsive to request. Makes working in large Excel and Visio files so much easier."


string(150) "Works great, feels great, and the extra buttons make work easier to do. The ultrafast scrolling feature is perfect for document reviewers like myself."


string(54) "Great mouse, very customizable and intuitive software."


string(79) "It is very expensive, but you are person who uses a mouse a lot it is worth it."


string(550) "This is the most expensive wireless mouse I have ever bought and 100% the BEST. I love the features this mouse has with the continuous free rolling scroller wheel along with the many features it has as well. The multiple buttons to use and simplicity of this mouse makes it the best. On top of all that; it’s the quietest mouse ever used with very minimal clicking noises. I definitely recommend it for anyone on the computer a lot or in my case using it for video and photography editing to speed up the process. I would definitely recommend this."


string(210) "Great mouse! Much quieter and smoother than the MX Master 2. I like it so much I bought one for home and for my desktop at work. The forward and back button placement is so much better than the previous models."


string(75) "This mouse is great. Very comfortable, and the new quiet buttons are great."


string(51) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 6"


string(95) "This thing is awesome! I highly recommend it. This can be programmed to three separate devices."


string(67) "Great mouse eith good button location. Satisfied with this purchase"


string(366) "Smooth. I like how the scroll wheel switches to smooth (rather then 'notched') scrolling automatically when it senses you are trying to scroll quickly. I dont really use the extra buttons but regardless the movement was worth the upgrade. I'm sure I'll start taking advantage of horizontal wheel once I get used to it; it has not got in the way which is what I like."


string(111) "it is very easy to use. its tactile control is superb. it works seamlessly on any surface with great precision."


string(81) "Excellent for work flow management and programming buttons. Pretty decent quality"


string(98) "Mouse is ok, but scroll wheel is not as convent as cheaper models and mouse has to be reset often."


string(76) "This was great. One of the best products I have ever purchased from Best Buy"


string(626) "Logitech MX Master mice series is the best on the market and nothing comes close to competing or even coming close in terms of a productivity mouse. I have bought 3 already since I like them so much and want other people in my family to use them as well. It has truly changed we work. BUT PLEASE DO NOT buy the white version if you were like me and wanted a clean white set up. The mouse discolours so quickly and I have tried every cleaning option known to man and it does not come off the soft rubber shell. It looks disgusting and nothing can clean it but the problem is there is no mouse better so just buy a darker colour"


string(629) "If you Google mx master 3 scrolling issue, you'll find this mouse (yes even the 3s) has issues detecting scrolling of you do it a certain way. Flicks of the wheel are fine. Slow rolls of the wheel are fine. But if you scroll too aggressively or jerky like me sometimes, this mouse fails to detect it while little every other mouse has no issues. As for clicking, at first it feels kind of mushy but you get used to it after a few hours and makes going back to loud mice unpleasant. Ergonomics are great, but the mouse is a little on the heavy side for my liking. Save money and get the m720. It has most of the features this has."


string(63) "Programming the buttons make it alot faster than the quick keys"


string(102) "This mouse is incredible. I can’t imagine how one could possibly be more comfortable and easy to use"


string(114) "Paired easily & works great with all personal devices. If using for work, make sure the software can be installed."


string(50) "Great mouse. Super customizable and great features"


string(79) "Great usable and easy to setup mouse. Makes using the computer more comfortable"


string(51) "Love the feel of this mouse. Ergonomically friendly"


string(87) "Great rechargable mouse. The design and multiple functions make this work like a dream."


string(121) "I like the shape of the mouse which is comfortable. The only thing that I don’t like is the sensitivity on Chromebooks."


string(1575) "TL;DR: Cursor will jump on Apple devices using the BOLT Nano Adapter 

Review:
Logitech make some of the best accessories on the market.  I have been a user of their MX series line since it came out years ago. As someone that uses their devices in a more professional environment, my use case will see that these devices are used more often than others. 

When Logitech announced that they will be moving to the new BOLT nano adapter for MX mouse series, I wanted to upgrade our existing MX Master 3 mouse to this new one.

That was a major mistake as the BOLT nano adapter is not 100% compatible with Apple's ridiculous requirements for external devices. If you plan to use this with an Apple device, common issues will be jumpy cursors, inconsistence scrolling and device time-outs. 

This has been well documented and acknowledged by Logitech and their Reddit support page. 

The device itself has a nice feel in the hand and as a Mac user, it offers enough creature comforts that using any other mouse sucks.

With that said, I have also tried using the mouse as a standard BT directly connected to the Apple Mac Studio, it should work for a period of time but will time out due to new Apple security policies. 

Another limitation to Apple is that they don't allow non-Apple products to control the computer before logging in.  This is one of the reason you need to use the NANO adapter as it functions as a connection keyboard/mouse connection. 

Would I recommend this mouse, Yes.  But not for Apple users.  This mouse will work great with Windows and Linux computers."


string(54) "for anyone who uses editing programs or loves comfort."


string(53) "Great ergonomic and comfortable mouse for office work"


string(51) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 7"


string(57) "Purchased as a Christmas gift for my father & he loves it"


string(120) "bought this mouse for work to use across multiple computers.  Now I want one for home too.  Best mouse I have ever used."


string(62) "Works well, but I wish the device switching button was on top."


string(92) "Awesome mousse and I have used many, this is the only one I will buy from now on, just do it"


string(1755) "Buyers take note.  This is a fantastic mouse, however, it now uses a different adapter (Bolt) than the MX Keys series (Unifying) over the previous 3 version, which is not cross compatible.  This means it is no longer unifying and requires a different wireless adapter than the MX Keys.

This is a change from the previous 3 model.  I specifically bought this along with the MX Keys to switch between three PC and Mac computers (Unifying), as I was aware of the good reputation for pairing the MX Keys and MX Master 3 together, and I splurged to finally replace three keyboards and mice.  Now, I'm stuck with either using Bluetooth only or returning it.

The 3 model was no longer available, and this was marketed as the new upgrade and even displayed together at Best Buy.   However, I discovered this change only after buying it.  You have to read the fine print to learn this.  I usually research these things to death before buying gear, but I trusted Logitech on this one.  Lesson learned.

Logitech, take note, if you're going to make a change this impactful it warrants more a more dissimilar model name.  I've since noticed a lot of other angry customers on forums mentioning they fell into this same trap, so I just wanted to share it here to help inform others.

Make no mistake, the 3S is a much better mouse spec-wise than the 3 series if this is not a factor for you.  I still love this mouse and am debating whether to keep it and use with Bluetooth.  You can get around this issue by using it only with Bluetooth, but there are technical reasons I prefer a receiver instead.
 
If it weren't for this issue I would have given it 5 stars, but  I'm docking two so people take notice.  If you know this going in and don't care, it's a great buy."


string(56) "Ergononic mouse, no issues. Best mouse for productivity."


string(296) "This is the first mouse I’ve gotten, after a lot of research I went for this I can say I am really happy so far, the latency is almost nonexistent, the quality is good, and if you are like me and don’t really like clicking sounds this version will be great. The setup process is really simple"


string(118) "Smooth scrolling and movement, comfortable grip, and awesome lateral scrolling that makes navigating spreadsheets easy"

Matching expectation
Best Buy: Best stor"

string(50) "Simply the best, look no further!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"


string(53) "Second one of these purchased. Fits well in the hand."


string(101) "I WFH and invested in a mouse. This is hands down the best mouse I ever used. You will not regret it."


string(178) "This mouse is very comfortable in my hand and I do not get cramping after a long day on the computer. I can detect smaller movements more quickly than my previous standard mouse."


string(84) "Just upgraded to this mouse from a razer, mu productivty has increased by 30 percent"


string(165) "This mouse exceeded my expecations. It feels very ergonmic and it doesnt make my wrist hurt despite using it all day like other have in the past. Highly recomend it."


string(121) "Excellent response, comfort and designed to pair with multiple computers. Replaced a track ball and reduced wrist strain."


string(1344) "The ergonomic design is comfortable to use for long periods of time and the ultrafast scrolling feature has made navigating through documents and websites a breeze. The customization options are also a great bonus, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs. The USB-C, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity options make it easy to use with a variety of devices.
First of all, the ergonomic design is top-notch. The shape of the mouse fits comfortably in my hand and the thumb rest and gesture button allow me to use the mouse without straining my hand or wrist. This is especially important for me as I tend to use a mouse for long periods of time and have experienced discomfort with other models in the past. The Logitech MX Master 3S has completely eliminated that issue for me.
The ultrafast scrolling feature is also a game-changer. I frequently have to scroll through long documents and websites, and the smooth and precise scrolling on the MX Master 3S makes that task much easier and more efficient. It's a small detail, but it has made a big difference in my daily workflow.
Overall, the Logitech MX Master 3S is a fantastic mouse that has greatly improved my productivity and comfort while using a computer. It's a high-quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone in need of a reliable and comfortable wireless mouse."


string(347) "Great mouse with very quiet clicks vs previous generations. There is definetely a bit of latency so I would not recommend this for gaming, but it's great for work and very comfortable. 

Do not get any colors other than black as the previous generation white mice discolored very quickly.

Price is a bit steep so definetely try to get it on sale."

string(710) "This mouse is great for discovering new ways to optimize your workflow. Every button being remappable for the entire device and on a per app basis is very nice to allow for ease of navigation and usability of certain apps. My only complaints are in the shape and weight of the mouse alongside the polling rate. I notice that the mouse only polls at 125hz which sometimes feels jittery due to dropped packages. The weight is a bit heavier than I'd like, and the shape misses some curves that could make the mouse fatiguing to use for a long duration for certain grip types. However these issues only apply tp those that use a lower DPI, and people that use a more typical high DPI will find no issues with this."


string(81) "Its great, quiet and smooth. At first it seemed big but I quickly got used to it."


string(104) "Great mouse you want be disappointed. Easy to use, little pricey, however, the productivity will offset."


string(106) "Mouse is ergnomically well designed but few operations especially gesture controls difficult to use. Pricy"


string(237) "If you suffer from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, this is the best choice for you! Incredibly comfortable and minimices any tight feeling on the wrist. This is a 10+ hrs daily use mouse. The BT and 3 Different Device usage option is pure gravy."

string(91) "Very nice mouse, really enjoy using it, only thing I would change is make it a bit smaller."


string(788) "With _one_ design flaw, this is the best mouse I have owned.

The form and functionality of the mouse are exceptional. It is ergonomically sculpted for use with a large, right hand. The scroll wheel is amazing and effortlessly zips through large amounts of vertically oriented information. Buttons are well placed (i.e., out of the way but easily enabled).

My only complaint is that the wireless dongle is USB A. My new laptop has only USB C ports and the dongle requires a C to A USB adapter. I wound up using Bluetooth for a dongle-free connection. This required that I keep Bluetooth active when in sleep mode. Otherwise, the mouse had to be reacquired every time the laptop woke up.

@Logitech, please design a USB C wireless dongle and include a USB C charging cable for this mouse."

string(139) "This is hands-down the best mouse I've ever owned. Horizontal scrolling, silent click, all the buttons, notched/endless vertical scrolling,"


string(111) "This is the best mouse I’ve ever used. Wish I was able to use the app (can’t due to using on work computer)"


string(66) "This was a gift for my wife and it worked out to be pefrct for her"

string(101) "Terrific mouse.  Comfortable, high quality and adaptable.  Logitech software easy to install and use."


string(205) "mouse is comfortable and ergnomically awesome.  the scroll wheel has some kind of inertia built in to it, so that if you spin the wheel hard enough, it'll keep scrolling and slow down gradually. very nice!"

string(80) "MX Master is one of the best mouse that you can get for yourself as a work setup"


string(173) "Good mouse a bit jerky and the scroll is too fast at first but with the help of the logitech app you download to support the mouses functions it becomes easier to deal with."


string(140) "This mouse has the latest greatest features operating between 3 devices is amazing. Wish they had the one-touch search only missing feature;"


string(101) "Good features and build quality. Something about the design hurt my hand/wrist/arm, so I returned it."


string(503) "I love almost everything about this mouse. Tracking awesome, customizable buttons, multi point Bluetooth, usb-c and side scroll (main reason I wanted this mouse). All great, just a little taller than I'm used to. Sometimes when moving from keyboard back to mouse my hand hits the top of the mouse and pushes it away, not a huge concern but takes some getting used to. That's my only complaint, if you're stepping up from a cheap Logitech keyboard and mouse bundle it takes a couple weeks to get used to."


string(169) "This mouse lives up to the expectations. Solidly built, easy to setup (windows computer). Multi functionality. I’m a logitech fan for a reason. They never let me down!"

string(77) "greatest mouse I've. easy to set up . easy on the hand . fast and easy to use"


string(189) "Excellent product. Great ergonomics (though not as good as MX Vertical). Buttons and controls are well tuned, great customization using the Logi Options+ app. Bit pricey. Very happy overall"


string(153) "This mouse is actually worth the higher price. The claims that it improves productivity are accurate and I believe that is due to how customizable it is."


string(54) "This mouse is silent and fits my large hand perfectly."


string(64) "Very responsive and versatile.  I like the feel of the movement."


string(52) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 11"


string(283) "I already had an MX Master 3 mouse when I bought this. I wanted to be able to keep one in my bag and leave the other on my desk so that I wouldn't forget it when I left. The "S" (Silent) version of this is a much bigger upgrade than I'd expected. The 3 is great. The 3S is fanatstic."


string(515) "This mouse is great.  Silent buttons that are fully customizable and the scroll wheel on the side feel great.  The infinite scrolling option is also really nice.  I love that I can have it connected to multiple devices and can switch it with the push of small button on the bottom.  Build quality feels good - it's fairly large with substantial weight.  Wouldn't be great for gaming due to weight but thats not who it's marketed to.  Definitely worth the money and far better than other options in this price range."


string(97) "Excellent response and smooth action. Easy set up with plenty of features. Solved my lag problem."


string(310) "This is a great mouse.  I bounce between a mac, surface and iPad and love that I can use the same mouse.  Just press a button and it pairs automatically to the device number 1, 2 or 3. (After you have done the initial setup.) The only negative I have is that it is a little pricey, but the performance is good."


string(91) "Love the silent clicks on this version! And definitely the best scroll wheels on the market"


string(50) "Love this mouse. Photoshop and lightroom made easy"


string(86) "Love the extra functionality built for the Mac, but it does seem a but laggy sometimes"


string(117) "I love this mouse! Very ergonomic and feels great! Inhave paired it with the logitech mx mini and its the best combo!"


string(133) "Has the best feel out of any Logitech mouse I've ever purchased, which has been quite a few.  Good ergonomics and feels high quality."


string(394) "This mouse has a lot of great features. I do a lot of text editing and it is very useful to have keybinds on the mouse for different applications. However I’ve found the keybinds inevitably are forgotten by my computer’s OS, or get mixed up. A system reset usually fixes the problem, but it happens at least one or two times a week. This shouldn’t be an issue on a product this expensive."


string(58) "I love this mouse!  That's it!  I love it!!!  Recommended!"


string(62) "What more do i need to say? Its a good, comfy, versitile mouse"


string(85) "The mouse works so well. Don’t even need a mouse pad and it works well on glass too"


string(123) "Great mouse! Good weigh. (I like heavy) quite click. It is a touch shorter than my original MX master, that I don’t like."


string(422) "Love this mouse, and I have never really cared about the mouse I would use until now. The programable buttons and the thumb wheel are great and useful. The scroll wheel can be switched between a click feel and free spinning and it makes scrolling up and down so much easier. It is a very quiet mouse when pushing down on the buttons, practically silent. The new dongle connects to both mouse and keyboard so that's a plus."


string(107) "Really nice mouse (and I’ve been through many). Silent, accurate, ergonomic, feels very soft in the hand."


string(141) "Built well. Comfortable. Smooth scrolling and pointer movement, though the scrolling gets a bit hung up at times. Great battery. A bit heavy."


string(103) "I love this mouse. I have tried so many in the past and this one is a keeper. It’s worth every penny!"


string(414) "Loved the ergonomics of this mouse. High DPI, free spin scroll, plenty of buttons and horizontal scroll wheel. Great build quality. Unfortunately I couldn't use this mouse because of interference of the other wireless items at my desk. For that I'm knocking off a star since the Razer mouse it's replacing worked fine until a button wore out. Also, if you have small hands this mouse might be a little big for you."

string(410) "I love this mouse more than I thought I would. It feels fantastic in the hands and once you download the LogiOptions+ you can customize the buttons and gestures to ahything you want. I love that it can be programmed to multiple devices so I move it between my work machine and personal MacBook. I didnt even relaize that theres an extra button where the thumb rests until just yesterday and it's game changing."

string(211) "This mouse is great. Works well with my computer. Just a really nice feeling and is great quality. Definitely more expensive for a day to day mouse, but if you are lookinh for a quality wireless mouse, get this."

I like that i can switch bluettoth between my computers very easily with the push of a button. If you can afford this I highly recommend"


string(79) "This is by far the best productive mouse I've had with even quieter click sound"


string(216) "As a mac and window user, this mouse is great. I really like that it is very quiet but tactile clicking. Also, it is heavier that a regular mouse which I prefer. The magnetic scroll wheel is great for speed browsing."


string(84) "Its really great for the price and helps ease the pain of long work hours on fingers"


string(90) "Built well. Replaces same mouse that lasted 4 years and 10’a of 1,000,000’s of clicks."

string(85) "Excellent mouse. Comfy, clicky, smooooth. Really upgraded my setup. Highly recommend."


string(65) "Great product, easy to use! Much more comfortable than I imagined"


string(225) "Unfortunately the MX3 was discontinued and the 3s replaced it. The difference is that the 3s does not have a click sound to it. It's actual silent. Not my cup of tea but the mouse performs just as the other Master mouses did."


string(167) "Super quiet if working in hotel rooms and not wanting to wake your lived one with the clicking sounds of the usual mouse and side scrolling excellent for spreadsheets."


string(1061) "OK, if it's so awesome, why not 5 stars? I partly blame Best Buy, buy mostly Logi. This mouse was on the same display cap as the rest of the Logi MX devices, but be aware, it uses a different dongle than the rest. The MX Keys that I have use the Logi Unifying Receiver dongle, and this MX Master 3S mouse uses the Logi Bolt dongle. They are NOT compatible, and thus you will have to use both dongles in your PC/Mac. 
The alternative is to pair both devices with Bluetooth which I will do and revise my review.
On to the rest...
The movement and scroll are really smooth. Significantly better that my old M705, which at the time, was the best Logi made. All of the buttons and wheel functions are programmable when you install the Logi Options+ App. Logi has also updated the charging port to USB C, which is the same as my MX Keys port.
It takes a little getting used to, but the side to side scroll is controlled by the wheel on the side, above your thumb and it is so smooth.
All in all, this mouse is a significant upgrade to my M705.
I totally recommend it."


string(246) "I loved the MX Master 3, but the 3S is just about perfect.  As others have said, this is just an improvement on top of an already great mouse, and at the same price point.  My only issue is I wish the device selection button wasn't on the bottom."


string(57) "Great product. Highly recommend. Price is decent as well."


string(843) "I've only purchased this item 3 weeks ago, and already they want me to "review" this thing! What can I say? It's just a friggin' mouse. It's not like it can do anything other than what it's made for. My only problem is that I can't configure it because STUPID Microsoft wants us to keep our PC in "S Mode", making it impossible to download the app for this mouse!! Sure, I can take it out of S Mode, but do I really want my PC susceptible to viruses or malware just to have the option to configure this mouse? With my luck, my computer will blow up the second I take it out of S Mode! Also, the only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is because I NEVER give a product a perfect score!! There's no such thing as a perfect product!! So, there! I'll just let the geeks, nerds, and dorks fight it out amongst themselves regarding stupid ratings!!"


string(69) "Work from home, this was exactly what I needed. Worth the investment."


string(92) "A really good mouse to use in the bed desk really anywhere. The Bluetooth switch is godsend!"

string(65) "Works as advertised. Easy to install. Excellent store assistance."


string(67) "I love this version. Glad I lost the version one to make me upgrade"


string(323) "Wireless receiver broke within a week of purchasing, For a $100 mouse you think it would be a little more robust, I ended up just returning it and saving the money. Beyond that the gesture button really isnt that use full, and using the horizontal scroll wheel is weird since it feels nothing like the regular scroll wheel."


string(119) "Love this mouse for both gaming and productivity! the wireless feature can allow you to connect to 3 different devices."


string(199) "A massive upgrade even over the fairly recent MX Master 3. The quite-ness of the clicks alone make this so much more usable than the Master 3. Never knew this is what I was missing until I bought it."


string(258) "A must have item for anyone using a mouse for long periods of time. I had the Master MX 3 and upgraded to this one for the silent clicks. Perfect for an office setting. Many customizable settings, great for developers and scrolling websites. Worth the price!"


string(74) "Great Buy. Comfortable and long lasting battery. I have no issues with it."


string(78) "This mouse is great…except when it randomly disconnects from my MacBook Pro."

string(125) "It’s Logitech.efforless connection. It feels good on your hand and the battery do last forever. It works on any surface too"


string(497) "I have owned a few renditions of the mx master mouses. The click is a lot quieter than the mx master 3, and i didnt appreciate that until i owned this one, but it shouldnt be a big impact on deciding between the 3 and 3s. The one quark ive noticed is when you scroll veritcal and then horizontal immediately, you need to pause a second, or it will continie to scroll in  the direction you first started. The reciever is also updated now and it doesnt connect to the orange logo unifying receivers."


string(252) "This mouse feels fantastic, I have bigger hands and wish it was slightly wider, but have since adopted a new hand positioning with three fingers on top of the mouse and pinky on the side as opposed to my standard two fingers on top and two on the side."


string(89) "Very nice and comfortable to use all day at work. The fast scroll feature is very useful."


string(89) "Love this mouse. Fast, silent. Love it so much its my second one. 1 for work, 1 for home!"


string(66) "love the way this feels while in use and love how smother if feels"


string(60) "Had to exchange it since you can't pair it with the MX Keys."


string(351) "This is the best mouse I have purchased all time. It is charged by USB and I have not had to charge it since I purchased it. I do turn it off after daily use averaging at least 8 hours of use a day. I have big hands the mouse fits comfortable. It has a quick reaction time for scrolling and clicking buttons. The product is pricey but so far worth it."


string(69) "Its the luxury model. I dont know that can go back to a common mouse."


string(67) "This is a great mouse for you desktop! Little big for a mobile use."


string(58) "It's a great lil device. Multi-device connectivity is key."


string(104) "A great mouse that is configurable and which can be used with up to 3 devices including Mac and Windows."


string(307) "This mouse is great! I purchased this mouse alongside the Mx mechanical keyboard and it has been the best combination I have ever used. I can use this mouse all day at my desk and I have no issues whatsoever. In my opinion, it is comfortable, reliable, and overall a great piece to have for your desk setup."


string(815) "The best Logitech product I've owned. Which admittedly isn't a high bar. The freescroll wheel makes it hard to go to a stiff, clicky, normal one.
Being able to re-assign the middle "freescroll" button to something else shows that the engineers designing it actually use this thing. I had two of the MX Master 1 but Im going on 3 years with this one and it still feels premium. I figured with my history that the Scroll would get messed up and start being janky, Thankfully I was wrong. One of the few times a premium item from Logitech is worth the recommendation. Higher DPI would be nice but doesn't really affect my usage of it. 

It has really just disappeared into my desk and usage, and only calls attention to itself when I have to use other "lesser" mice, Which is exactly what you want from any peripheral."


string(81) "Very comfortable, fast and accurate.
Not for gaming but good for everything else."

string(185) "Smooth. Fast. Functional. Silent. This mouse made school work, internet browsing, and productivity work a breeze. The silent mouse clicks are great too at night for long study sessions."


string(104) "A long overdue upgrade from a previous MX, feels great and have an awesome precision, an worthy upgrade!"


string(274) "I have been using the MX Master since Gen 1 and they have come a long way. The MX Master 3S is perfect. It's a lot quieter with its clicks (which is if you want loud clicks pick up a regular master 3 or another other MX Master. Solid mouse with great customization software."


string(1010) "This mouse is the best I've ever had.  I immediately had a  "where have you been all my life" moment upon first use.

The shape is good.  I have big hands and the body is allows for various hand positions.  It would be good for a small handed person, too.  Maybe even better.  

The scroll wheel is unlike anything I've used before.  There is a "brake" on it, and when engaged, it has those small clicks like a normal mouse scroll wheel.  You'd want to use that for scrolling down a web page, for example.  Whenever you want a lot of control.  But the best part is if you spin that scroll wheel hard, or disengage the brake, it will just spin...for a very long time.  You could scroll down 1000 pages with one flick of your finger.  No joke.  The scroll wheel must have a little weight to it because it will spin forever.  If you find yourself scrolling large distances in large documents or code, you will love this mouse.

Battery life is outstanding.  There's no RGB but that's okay.  

Best.  Mouse.  Evar."


string(124) "I love it, I can connect to 3 devices via Bluetooth and switch between devices by clicking a button..very good battery life."

Logitech is dumb to release this when the app you have to install to use functions will not install if you try to install in work computer. Your IT department cannot install this for you.

string(198) "I was pretty hesitant to spend $100 on a mouse, but it's worth it. I work in databases, spreadsheets and IDE's all day and the smooth scroll, side scroll and extra buttons are now must haves for me."


string(52) "Logitech makes great mice, I love the MX series mice"


string(183) "Fast and accurate no real major compaints, just wish it had the option for removable AA batteries along with the ability to charge via USB c. Just would make it a bit more convienient"


string(109) "Been rocking these since the first edition.  Love them and will only use these one all work and home set ups."


string(115) "Mouse is very smooth and you can customize all buttons & gestures. Highly recommend for any creator or light gamer."


string(327) "I bought this because my hand would start hurting from using a non ergonomic mouse all day.  I lost my first one after two years because I take it everywhere.  Went to the store and immediately bought my second one.  If you use a computer all day one of the best investments you can make.  Comfort and productivity went way up."


string(103) "I love this mouse this is my first MX mouse from Logitech it has all the functionality I'm looking for."


string(80) "It's a very smooth working mouse and an awesome product for people to work with."


string(115) "pairs great with MX keys.  really smooth.  took a few days to get comfortable, since its larger than the old mouse."


string(160) "I bought this mouse replace and older version of this mouse. It works perfect and I like the fact you can customize the buttons on this mouse. Highly reccomend."


string(141) "Without a doubt a must for the photo editor. The mouse works great with everything but it can’t be beat for the ease of use with Lightroom."


string(94) "good mouse. use it every day for work. recommended. only drawback is its little bit expensive."


string(688) "I own both the MX Master 3 and the 3S. They are virtually identical with some minor differences in coloring.  The biggest, noticeable improvement is that the 3S has significantly quieter left and right click buttons.  I believe there have been improvements to the sensor as well but for standard, everyday use, it's not something that stands out. Overall, the mouse and software are phenomenal and easily configured. Physically, it's very comfortable to use for long periods of time. I tried out Logitech's ergonomic mouse as well for comparison but the upright configuration is actually less comfortable to use.  I'd highly recommend this 3S model (or the 3 is perfectly sufficient too)."


string(63) "Great mouse that can customized for different apps or programs!"


string(67) "The absolute best mouse I have ever used for pleasure & production!"


string(767) "Great mouse. I like the quiet click. The scrolling wheel and side button is great. The reason why I would return this mouse and never buy it again is because of the 2 feet long cable. 
Yes, it's a wireless mouse, but if the battery is dead, how am I suppose to charge it with a 2 feet long cable that can't even reach the port on my PC.
Seriously, Logitech. This is where you decided to cut cost on a $100 mouse? a 2 feet long USB-C charging cable. 
Your company used to have #1 customer support and you decided to cheap out on a premium product.  
I thought this 2-foot long cable was only on your $100 mouse, but it's not. I also purchased the Logitech MX mechanical. I also got another 2-foot long charging cable. FOR A $170 keyboard. a 2-foot long charging cable!"


string(387) "The touch and feel of this mouse is excellent.  The button actions and sounds are super quiet.  It has all the functions and buttons I need to navigate large spreadsheets with ease.  The "Flow" function is amazing...allowing me to use the mouse on two separate devices at the same time and it will automatically transfer as I move the mouse from screen to screen (ON SEPARATE COMPUTERS)."


string(275) "I bought this mouse to replace a Logitech Ergo trackball. I'd heard good things about it from graphic designers and, even though I write and don't do much design, I thought I'd try it. I'm still learning how to set it up and use it the best way for me, but so far it's great."

string(141) "One of the best things period I have gotten in a long time. Works great! Feels great! The ability to switch to another machine is very handy!"


string(79) "The mouse is great. Its a good size for larger hands. The setup was super easy."


string(133) "Everything about this mouse is amazing. Feels great in your hand. Love the thumb rest. Works great on my desktop without a mouse pad."


string(174) "I currently own the original MX Master and I love it so much that I bought this for my wife to replace another MX mouse. Easy to use and great quality. I highly recommend it!"


string(489) "Loved this mouse when I first got it. Silent buttons feel great and the overall shape of the mouse is perfect. After a month of use, the rubberized coating on the mouse has picked up some dirt and dis-coloured significantly. I can't imagine how this mouse will look in a few more months. Nothing I have tried cleans the dis-colouration.

I do NOT recommend buying this mouse until Logitech fixes the formulation/composition of the rubberized coating on this mouse or removes it altogether."


string(93) "I love this mouse. Silent with every click is simply the best. Small and compacy for my hand."


string(341) "Not like the second gen, but still nice. I'm rough with mice so the previous gen held up quite nicely. This one is designed to be quieter and a tad smaller it also feels a little more fragile, hard to explain. I have bigger hands and this is fine, but I miss the old design. Still the best mouse there is, but I'm curious to see what's next."


string(143) "I upgraded from the MX Master 2 that I bought about 6 years ago, enough said.

My only gripe how the configuration of the side buttons changed."


string(368) "I'm a design I draw using autoCAD every day.  I purchased the MX Master Wireless Laser Mouse 10/9/2015 it lasted almost 7 years, loved it. No issues with it so I recently purchased MX Master 3S Wireless Laser Mouse, the new model is better then the old, the grip is slight improved, the functions are a bit crisper and the right click is quieter.  I'd buy another one."


string(173) "Had an MX Anywhere 3s and wanted to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  It is very sharp and accurate and very much alleviates the pains in my hands when holding a mouse."


string(147) "Great great productivity Mouse, BUT stay away from the white colour option, it get stained easily and I had to return it for the Black/grey option."


string(142) "Best mouse ever. Some might not like the feel of the click since it’s not like your traditional mouse, but I’m very happy with it overall."


string(122) "Never used an "upgraded" mouse before.  Just stuck with the plain old Logitech mice before.  It's a world of a difference."


string(85) "Glad I bought this it helps move between screens and from laptop to pc very smoothly."


string(129) "Amazing mouse especially when paired with the logitech keyboard for mac. Very ergonomic design, and a major productivity booster."


string(59) "Best mouse yet for very smooth usage and pairing is simple."


string(357) "It’s been great to use.  I love the horizontal scrolling for spreadsheets and it seems quite fluid in motion compared to others.  It’s very comfortable to use.  It paired to both my Mac and my pc immediately.  The only drawback is that it is bulky to carry around.  I’m afraid it’s going to get broken in my bag as I take it from work to home daily."


string(52) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 19"


string(59) "This mouse is quiet.  Upgraded from master 3 and i love it."


string(248) "Best mouse I have used in a while.  I normally hate using a mice, but this mouse is responsive and allows you to quickly navigate through windows and web pages.  In addition it doesn’t require a using dongle it’s Bluetooth and its rechargeable."


string(257) "Love, Love, Love this mouse. It is so light and has a great click to it. I'm using it with my MacBook Air and there isn't a delay at all. My husband even tried it and was surprised at the lightness of the mouse and the smoothness of the clicking of buttons."


string(79) "Beautifully built and with terrific battery life. Very responsive and accurate."


string(220) "The MX Master 3S delivers as promised. The Bluetooth setup was quick and easy. Smooth and accurate cursor movement any both my desk top or mousepad. Easy scrolling and ultra-quiet operation. Definitely worth the upgrade."


string(316) "Great mouse. For photo editing and vide editing it is great. Smooth and reliable. I have it connected to a macbook air as well as my ipad and it is easy to transition between both. Customizable buttons within individual apps make this mouse extraordinarily versatile and I don't think I can go back to anything else!"


string(112) "Everyone always ask me am I working because they never hear a CLICK.  This is the best MUSE I have ever trapped."


string(192) "I bought this mouse because I have had a broken wrist and I’m at my computer for multiple hours at a time.  This makes a huge difference.  I no longer have joint pain while working or after."


string(65) "Easy connect, fluid movement, comfortable. Multi computer connect"


string(75) "This mouse is the best I have every used.  Seamless set-up.  Ergonomic fit."


string(92) "Mouse performs per Logitech's write-up.  Easy to install, long battery life, and very quiet."


string(115) "Clicking feels better than the MX Master 3. It's not worth the upgrade though unless you truly need a silent click."


string(125) "Definitely like the ability to connect to multiple computers.  Rechargeable battery is nice too.  Good precision of movement."


string(63) "Excellent mouse with great feature set. Would recommend highly."


string(348) "I tried several mice from Logitech before landing on this one. Ultimately, the Logi Bolt connection and gestures feature are what sold me. I can quickly access file folders by reassigning the buttons and even change the smoothness of my pointer. The feel of the unit is very ergonomic and comfortable. I’m actually shopping for another right now."


string(139) "Love this mouse, great ergonomics and fits good in my hand. Lots of buttons to customize. I use the Adobe Creative suite and it is perfect."


string(143) "Best mouse- take advantage of the customizable buttons, I use copy/paste and screenshot very often. Soft click is great for being in the office"


string(338) "Great ergonomics and the customizable buttons for specific apps is a very useful feature. Was previously using a Magic Mouse but my hand would cramp after long periods of editing. I love that I didn’t loose the ability to use the gestures such as Mission Control and switching between desktops. I am also enjoying the side scroll wheel."


string(133) "The mouse is comfortable, quiet and reliable! The ability to quickly switch between multiple sync'd computers is very useful as well."


string(159) "I chose this mouse because my arthritic thumb felt best on it. I am not a gamer, but I appreciate how faster and smooth it is. It's been an excellent purchase."

string(181) "Absolutely the best traditional mouse available. The button/wheel layout and function is intuitive. This mouse has capabilities that create opportunities for increased productivity."


string(138) "Absolutely love this mouse from the minute I pulled it out of the box! Its comfortable, quiet and works great!! Love the bluetooth option."


string(123) "Best mouse on the market - With Mac to iPadOS universal control, you can control 4 devices with this mouse, not just three."


string(63) "First decent mouse and it is worth the upgrade over a basic one"


string(249) "I really wanted to like this mouse, the form factor, buttons, software are all good.  I like that it is Bluetooth.  However, for me, with large hands using a mix of palm and fingertip grips, it just was uncomfortable.  Unfortunately I returned this."


string(94) "Great mouse, super quiet clicking. The updated version is a good improvement on a great mouse."


string(192) "There's a ton of reviews online about these so I won't be writing a novel about their pros and cons. But I will say, if you use an Apple Magic Mouse and work long hours, this is the way to go."


string(86) "Love this product. By far my favorite mouse. I especially love the ultrafast scrolling"


string(296) "Great mouse.  Very smooth and easy to use.  Very easy set up.  The only disappointment is that the receiver is not the same receiver that my MX keyboard uses.  I have to use to two different receivers for the wireless keyboard and this mouse.  The buttons and the wheels are very smooth and quiet"


string(220) "I haven’t used a mouse in a long time and when I last did it was nothing compared to this the comfort and accuracy all are top notch here and anybody who is anybody should use it .worth the price and its multiple uses."


string(66) "love the minimal click sound. better that the previous generation."


string(336) "This mouse is very comfortable and functional! It connected easily to both my desktop and laptop and moves seamlessly between both, even at the same time. I love it! The only small drawback for me is the texture of the scroll wheel. It is metal with little notches in it and irritates my fingernail slightly, but I’m glad I bought it."


string(65) "Nice functions, fits the hand well, very smooth with the movement"


string(153) "LIKE THIS ONE A LOT.  NO NEED FOR LITTLE PLUG-IN BECAUSE IT IS ALSO BLUETOOTH.  GREAT BECAUSE I AM ALWAYS MISPLACING IT.  SMOOTH AND VERY EASY TO HANDLE."


string(210) "Fantastic mouse. Has a few buttons on it that you can hotkey to do different things with the logi app such as scroll, zoom, copy/paste, etc. would buy again. Battery hasn’t died on me yet since purchase date."


string(152) "Awesome mouse for my Mac mini. Great feel. Amazing connectivity. Great value for the price. Great build quality and feature set for a none gaming mouse."

string(146) "so smooth and quiet. Very glad that I waited and bought the 3s. The new switches are almost silent; especially when compared to the older 3 or 2s."


string(175) "I am so much more efficient with these mouses. You can completely customize. I have a "copy" and "paste" and so many other buttons you can customize to be extremely efficient."


string(75) "so far love the mouse easy to operate does every thing i need plus some !!!"


string(263) "Love the size, feel and function of this mouse. Actually, there are some many possibilities with it you just have to dive in one at a time. Great scrolling. Full size feel. Vertical scrolling OR scrolling through open desktops. The battery life is beyond awesome."


string(462) "Absolutely love this mouse. Quick pairing via bluetooth and the new Logi bolt receiver has been very seamless. I use this device everyday, actively paired to a Windows machine, Mac M1 Pro and Linux machine. *Logi Options+ is not supported on Linux, but the mouse still functions as a standard mouse.

No hiccups, and the scroll wheels are incredibly satisfying to use. Being able to create application profiles for each button's function has been a game changer!"


string(160) "the perfect mouse...had a previous version that I loved and it died so I needed a replacement and was not sure if it would as good, but its better and I love it"


string(160) "I use this mouse for music and video production/ I also use it for gaming, nothing competitive, but it works perfectly. I'll never stray away from the MX series"


string(111) "Definitely is worth it!! It feels great and very easy to work on all Platforms,, very Music and gaming friendly"


string(98) "Excellent ergonomics, keys are quiet but with a nice feel. Buttons and customizations are awesome."


string(55) "It’s responsive and filled with programmable options."


string(71) "This thing works and feels better than I ever thought a mouse could be."


string(85) "Replaced my mouse at work, and now its hard to use another mouse! "fits like a glove""


string(60) "smooth operation, good features, nice fit for the right hand"


string(153) "So far, so good. I really like it !!  I would give it 4 stars if it wasn't so pricy.  But still, I really really like it !! Best mouse I have had so far."


string(417) "As a former owner of the MX Master 2, it was a no brainer when I decided to upgrade to the MX Master 3S.  The added bonus was pairing this up to the new MX Mechanical Keyboard from Logitech.  Only consuming one USB port with the Logitech Bolt dongle, along with the flawless connection and long battery life per charge, left me with zero buyer's remorse.  Not the cheapest solution out there, but definitely the best."


string(97) "You don’t know how nice the quiet clicks are until you use a different mouse, loving this thing"


string(734) "Great mouse, silent clicks compared to the predecessor MX Master 3. Build quality is great, lots of buttons you can customize. If you have small hands the MX Anywhere series may be more comfortable and better suited. Definitely try it out in store before you buy! Great for productivity, but not so much for gaming as it’s too heavy and may not be as accurate. Beware that the usb receiver is Logitech Bolt, not Logitech Unifying so your previous Unifying devices (like Mx anywhere) will not connect with new receiver. This mouse can connect to multiple devices and switch in between with button on bottom. Works flawlessly with MacOS and Windows although it works better on mac if you plug in usb receiver (with usb c to a adapter)"


string(184) "This is the only brand of mouse that I will buy. I currently have two of them. I have had probably five over the last couple of years. I usually upgrade when the new version comes out."


string(196) "The unit is easy to use and feels great in my hand.  There is a nice app that make a lot easy movements.  With all the buttons to use for everything you could possibly want it make it a no brainer"


string(52) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 22"


string(232) "Two small improvements over the Master S: the sensor has double the resolution and there are no "clicks" from using the mouse. Great ergonomics, long battery life, extremely customizable. Best mouse on the market for Mac or Windows."


string(289) "Great for everything, hyperscroll wheel is great for going through lots of files quickly, multiple buttons to try out and can format them based on what application you need them for. And good thumbrest placement making it feel comfortable. Also silent clicking is satisfying while working."


string(763) "I have been using some iteration of the MX for so many years I cannot even remember how long it has been. With each one, they get better. The changes are subtle with this newest version, but still nice improvements. 

The click is not "clicky" anymore, but rather silent. It was strange at first, but I am really liking it. There is also increased DPI control and parameters. Beyond that, a little bit of a different look and feel, both of which I like.

It is still the same fantastic productivity mouse. Comfortable. Numerous buttons in all the right places. Scroll wheel speed control. Perhaps most importantly, the excellent Logi software that gives you complete control over the mouse, globally, and in specific programs. 

All in all, this is a great mouse."


string(65) "very smooth, very quiet, and the logitech app is very well set up"


string(304) "If you are in need for a mouse that can support multiple devices than this is the one you need to buy. Also, if we love noiseless clicks on the mouse, I think this is the best in the market. I use it for 3 devices and works seemless. The battery backup is also great. I charge once every two weeks or so."


string(363) "While I do feel that this mouse is a little bit overrated, it is still quite a good mouse. Its greatness really has to do with with the software allowing gestures which really is on most newer logitech mouses. The one thing this mouse has is button on the side which honestly is really weird to reach and press. But still in general its still a really good mouse."


string(72) "Amazing for excel and jumping between work, school, and personal laptops"


string(129) "Incredible upgrade from an MX2.  Much smoother and more precise on high def screens.  Totally silent click is very nice addition."


string(104) "It’s a bit pricey, but the mouse has been great! Very smooth. I love that it connects up to 3 systems!"


string(190) "This is my second MX Master 3S and I am more than happy with its performance. Logitech seems to keep improving on their mice and keyboards. Just when you thought it could not get any better."


string(269) "I am enjoying this new Logitech Mouse so far.  It's like the older version but it now has the USB dongle.  I has some issues with the dongle a few times but overall seems to be working ok.  I'm hoping there are some updates to make sure the connection is more reliable."


string(106) "The sexiest and most comfortable office mouse I've used. Well worth the money and feels extremely premium."


string(75) "Definitely the best you can expect. It is super sharp and very comfortable."


string(510) "Pros:
-The shape and ergonomics are good for me. 
-Magnetic scroll wheel is incredible.
-Thumb wheel + thumb button

Cons:
-The mouse tends to stutter and lag, with the cursor getting "stuck" for a few milliseconds. 
-Buttons feel like mush.
-Connectivity issues with the LogiBolt receiver (may be why it's stuttering)
-Logitech Options+ feels either limiting or a source of the stuttering.

The stuttering is tolerable for office work or web browsing, but completely unusable for anything requiring precision."


string(117) "I have only had this mouse for a little less than a month. And it is a game changer with it’s programmable buttons."


string(117) "Best productivity mouse on the market. I was upgraded from MX 3 , not much changed . But prefer latest and greatest ."


string(142) "I had the MX Anywhere 3 before this and I liked it, but this is way better and more comfortable, especially for productivity and long term use"


string(107) "I upgraded to this mouse from the magic mouse. I like that it comes with both wireless and Bluetooth modes."


string(1013) "First off, if you already own an MX Master 3, then bother with this. It’s pretty much the exact same thing, but the mouse buttons are silent instead of clicky. That might actually be a dealbreaker for some. However, if you’re in the market for a great mouse then I can tell you that this thing is worth every single penny. Mice come in all shapes and sizes, but none of them hold up to the comfort, quality, and sheer production value of this thing. It handles like a dream, has plenty of buttons for amazing productivity (i.e. the side scroll wheel for excel spreadsheets and website navigation), and that scroll wheel is absolutely amazing. I personally use it for scrolling endless amounts of PDF pages for work. I laugh whenever I hear my colleagues continuously scroll using those cheap plastic mice that come with their computers. This mouse just changes the way that you use a computer. Now that I’ve used one, I can’t imagine what life would be like not having it. Everyone should have this mouse."


string(173) "I love the Logitech MX Master Mouses. My only tiff is the placement of the hot keys under the side scroller. Not the best ergonomically. My MX Master 1 is still my favorite."


string(52) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 23"


string(56) "Works great. A lot of customizability and great battery!"


string(226) "This has been a great mouse in combination with my Logitech MX Keys keyboard. Using it in Bluetooth mode has worked very well and, thankfully, doesn't require the USB transmitter, since my Dell XPS laptop has only USB-C ports."


string(144) "Very smooth transition when moving the arrow.  LOVE that the thumb is on the mouse instead of the surface!  Lightweight and easy to move around."


string(324) "Great mouse for multiple workstations. The ability to auto switch between workstations is kind of mind blowing. Battery life is next to none. Haven’t had to charge the mouse a single time yet since I bought it (today is 7/12/2022) I use it all day for both work and gaming if that gives you an idea of how much use it gets"


string(96) "I have only used the basic features so far, but the mouse works well and has a comfortable grip."


string(121) "I have alway loved the quality and usability of Logi peripherals. They also back their products up with a great warranty."


string(227) "I was using apple Magic mouse. I bought this one as an upgrade and really I feel like my hand is in a spa just for itself. So so comfortable. Just feeling sorry for myself using that mouse all those years instead of this one..."


string(113) "Best feature is seamless connectivity with 3 different devices. Worked with both mac and windows. Easy to switch."


string(195) "Amazing silent clicks, good for productivity. Wish polling was better. I only got this because my dog tore up my old master 3, but imo its not worth the upgrade if you already have the regular 3."


string(121) "This is an amazing mouse, but keep in mind that since it is Bluetooth…there is still a decent amount of lag time sadly."


string(89) "Love this mouse! Super easy setup. Great ergonomics and responsiveness. Highly recommend."


string(97) "Very smooth and quiet compare to the previous generation. I would recommend this mouse to anyone."


string(337) "I’ve had it for a few weeks and I have zero complaints. Much smoother then the prior generations and definitely the best mouse in the series yet. I’ve owned every mx and have had connection issues every once in a while with them, but not with this one yet.  IMO it’s the Best mouse for video editing and productivity on the market."


string(586) "Replaced MX Master 2 when sensor malfunctioned (dust-related) and mouse quit reliably tracking on glass. The replacement MX3S is better with more adjustability via software and still fits my hand. If you have a small hand like my wife, this may not be your best choice. Tracking is excellent on glass and hard surfaces. Recharging is now done by USB-C and is quicker than the previous model. I have not had it long enough to know how long between charges, but after a week, it remained nearly fully charged according to the LED flashes when recharging. High quality and worth the money."


string(120) "I would say one of the best quality mice I have purchased. Like the sound when clicking. Very smooth. Very good product."


string(279) "Took a few days to get used to the feel of this mouse, but it is an absolute game changer for me. I frequently need to switch between my work PC and my personal Mac, and this makes that very simple. The feel of the mouse is awesome as well, very ergonomic and has a silent click."


string(83) "It’s very quiet and I love it. The old one Was good but this is faster and better"


string(231) "I like the mouse and it definitely does has a nice silenced click. However, personally I prefer the clickier so unless you need to be more quiet in an office setting or something of the sort, the sort of muted click is not for you."


string(101) "The amount of customizable buttons with the gestures is amazing. This will really change my work flow"


string(125) "I've been using this mouse at work and home for several days, and besides some minor issues with the scroll is a great mouse."


string(52) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 24"


string(1091) "This thing is absolutely terrible on Macs. I have an M1 Mac Mini, updated, the mouse/software are fully updated, and I have nothing but problems.

This is a huge step back from the MX Master 2 I had prior in virtually every single way. The scrolling is atrocious, the mouse will suddenly bug out and skip all over the place, the tracking is terrible, the whole thing is a mess.

I have tried using with/without the USB receiver and it's terrible both ways.

After searching around various forums, I'm finding that Mac users in particular are having problems. It boggles my mind that it has almost nothing but 5 stars here as I write this, this thing is a MASSIVE step back from both the original and the MX Master 2.

You know those really cheap $10 mice with terrible unresponsive scroll wheels with terrible tracking? It feels like a prettier version of that.

Avoid! The MX Master 2 is great, this is just Logitech searching for yet another reason to reinvent the mouse and change things for the sake of changing things because how often can they continue to sell us the same peripherals?"


string(94) "Pros:
Super fast
Smooth movements
Quiet clicks

Cons:
Left thumb button is a bit hard to click"


string(334) "Great design, comfortable mice but lacks in Flow technology. While working with Flow and switched to different computer this mice doesn't work. Need to turn off and wait for few seconds and turn it on again. I was there were switching computer buttons on the top like M720.  For $100, without proper Flow and easy switch not worth it."


string(588) "I had this mouse for too short of a time, yet it’s my favorite mouse of all time. I made the mistake of returning this mouse for an Apple Magic Mouse thinking I’d prefer the “Apple” ecosystem experience and the multi-touch controls, but I was so wrong and have been living with the wrong mouse since. I’ll likely be buying another of these before the year ends and seling my Apple Mouse 2. Definitely buy if youre a multi-tasker and need/want multi device switching on the fly. Programability of the functions is nice as well. 10/10 great design. Oh, and it was comfortable too!"


string(127) "Comfortable mouse with constant disconnection issues using the provided USB dongle. Bluetooth connection is much more reliable."


string(179) "I’ve been looking for a mouse to help scroll though spreadsheets and other documents. It’s lived up to the other reviews, it’s a great mouse and you won’t be disappointed."


string(69) "Good mouse but not worth the price tag for laptop with existing mouse"


string(60) "Great mouse, works well.  Sensitivity button is placed well."


string(1232) "I have only owned the original MX Master mouse, which finally stopped working recently and would no longer charge. This new version of the mouse was my replacement purchase for that, and it's an awesome update to the original model. It is very comfortable in the hand, and doesn't feel all that different from the original model. The original MX mouse also needed to be recharged every few days for me, which was often quite annoying. I have owned this new 3S mouse for a couple of weeks now and the original charge is still at 65% despite heavy use every day. So it doesn't appear that I will need to recharge this mouse very often at all. Another thing I really like about this new version is the nearly silent clicks. You literally can barely hear it when you click on the buttons, and it just seems flawlessly smooth in operation. Another nice upgrade is the increased 8K DPI resolution tracking. If you have a large 4K display connected, you can literally just zip the cursor from one corner of the screen to another super fast with this enabled. The scroll wheel is also far smoother to operate, and you can use hyper-scrolling. And yes, it literally can track on a glass surface. I'm extremely pleased with this new 3S mouse!"


string(248) "Quiet, smooth, and convenient. The mouse is satisfying to hold and I haven’t found a surface it doesn’t accurately track on. The mouse clicks are silent and barely audible, and the technology in the scroll wheel makes long documents effortless."

string(309) "I previously had the MX Master 3 and it was awesome! I did however did not like the clicks on the mouse. The 3S is awesomer! lol.

string(1976) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] An optical mouse is nothing new for any of us in 2022. Even wireless mice are probably considered old school by now. So, why is this the better option than what you already have?

Ultimately, this does what every other mouse does, but just a little bit better. It comes with a few extra buttons (and wheel) which are very easy to customize with the downloadable software. In particular, I really appreciate the sun wheel that sits directly below your left some along with the included back/forward buttons. You can customize any of these buttons to whatever keystroke you’d prefer, but I find the default settings to be perfect for me. Assuming you are right handed, this may be the most comfortable mouse I’ve ever used.

Tracking is fast and very precise, and while it is not marketed as a gaming mouse, it seems more than adequate for that application, as well. Compared to my wired “gaming mouse“, I really can’t discern a difference (although I am admittedly not a hard-core, third person shooter, kind of guy)…. 

Wireless performance is seamless, as would be expected. One of the nice features of this particular mouse is that it can be connected either via Bluetooth or using the wireless dongle connected to a open the USB port. I can’t discern any particular latency with either option. It does have a onboard memory that will remember multiple devices, so it is easy to switch use from your desktop to a laptop, for example.

Wow this does have some nice bells and whistle‘s, ultimately what matters is whether or not it functions as you would expect.  As already stated, for me this mouse is a solid improvement over my prior pointing device, and just seems a bit more polished in every way. For something that we use for probably 75% (conservative estimate) of our computer interaction - which for many of us can be several hours a day - this is more than a worthwhile investment. Two thumbs up!"

string(287) "This is a great mouse for general productivity and office work.  I bought this for work but have the MX Master 3 at home.  The noticeable difference here is that the left and right button click is almost silent on the 3S, and the use of Logi Bolt instead of a Logitech Unifying receiver."


string(797) "First, this feels like a very nice mouse. It's got a little heft to it and the scrolling is very cool.

That said, it didn't do anything for me from an ergonomic standpoint over any of my other mice. I have relatively small hands for a guy (probably average for a girl), and my middle finger gets overextended. After about 10 minutes of use I knew I couldn't keep this.

Additionally, the Logitech software didn't recognize the mouse, so I couldn't customize any settings (despite using the included Logitech dongle and such). I'm sure I could have gotten it working with updates or reinstalling drivers, or something, but it's kind of unfortunate it didn't just work out of the box.

Overall, this is a very nice, premium feeling productivity mouse. If my hands were larger, I'd probably keep it."

I wish the button to switch PCs was in a different location (it is on the bottom), but it make sense.  I just don't like lifting and flipping the mouse, just to switch."


string(226) "I finally decided to give up the Magic Mouse and I’m never looking back.

The MX Master 3S is amazing and setup was real straightforward. 

Horizontal scrolling and the silent click is a deal maker. Pairing was easy as well."


string(170) "My previous Logitech MX mouse was getting old. I purchased this new Logitech - MX 3S mouse and am very pleased with it. It feels more accurate, and the clicks are softer."


string(2189) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been using this mouse at work and home for several days, and I really want to love it. 

To start with, there's a lot of good here. The tracking sensor is very accurate and works on every surface I've tried, from a glass tabletop to a bedsheet that always gives other mice trouble when using my laptop in bed. It's got a variety of DPI settings from 200 to 8k that make working on high resolution displays or small surfaces a breeze. I'm still figuring out all of the stuff a horizontal scoll wheel is useful for. I was surprised when I found it allows me to quickly zoom in and out or adjust the size of brush in photoshop, for example. The buttons and scroll wheels are near silent, which is interesting, but not particularly useful to me, so I can take it or leave it. As quiet as they are, they still have enough tactile feedback that it doesn't feel strange. 

In general, this mouse feels different to other mice I have, and I'm not entirely sure why. I feel like it sits higher overall, but fits to my hand in much the same way. It's not really any more or less comfortable, just different.

Battery life so far is great. I've been using it for five days and haven't had to recharge it yet. The wireless mouse I normally use needs to be plugged in about every two or three days to charge with moderate use. 

Unfortunately, it's got a bit of a problem with the vertical scroll wheel. It's just not accurate. Sometimes I'll wheel down a "notch" and nothing happens, or I'll be scrolling down and it'll just stop for a moment before it starts registering again. It's noticeable when it happens, and it happens often enough to be annoying. Even the cheapest of basic mice don't tend to have this problem, so I really don't expect it to happen with a premium product like this. I tried the Logi Options+ software to see if there was a firmware update available, but it said the mouse was up to date. Hopefully a future update can fix it.

All things considered, it's a great mouse in a lot of ways, and Logitech products are generally high quality, so I'll recommend it under the assumption that that mine just has a rare defect."


string(1065) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This mouse was very easy to get working with my laptop! I pulled it out of the box, turned it on, and my laptop immediately asked me if I wanted to connect to it using Bluetooth. I didn't have all of the functionality that the software provides, but it worked immediately as a standard mouse.

The software allows you to customize the buttons on the mouse to have quick-click functionality for whatever environment you're using it in. I like scrolling through tabs with the thumbwheel, personally.

The design of the mouse feels more ergonomically correct than most mice I've used over the last 28 years, and it has a fantastic weight, giving it a solidity that they have often been lacking. The texture of the surface is pleasant, and it really looks and feels like they put a lot of thought into the aesthetics.

The battery seems like it will last a long time, but the fact that the USB-C port is on the front of it will make using as a "wired" mouse while it's charging will not be a problem in the slightest."


string(353) "Wanted a mouse for my iPad. Tried two mouses prior to the mx by Logitech. Logitech out performed both of the previous products by far. The scrolling wheel actually works as advertised and the thumb wheel is absolutely a must have when editing video. Top notch product by a top notch company. Price tag wasn’t the greatest but you get what you pay for."


string(666) "As a Mac user I bought the previous Mx Master 3 mouse, 3 days before the release of the 3s. I didn't like the loud click of the 3 so got tempted to order the 3s. Instantly knew I prefer the 3s.
The advantages are the silent click and higher Dpi sensor. The sensor is beneficial if you want to move across the screen with minimal wrist movement or if you have multiple monitors. At 8k dpi you'll be able to move across a 27" screen with almost no noticeable wrist movement.

If you never used the MX Master mouse before, the magic are the custom programmable buttons in the Options software. I always used the magic trackpads from Apple but now use this mouse mainly."


string(64) "Hard to go back to any other mouse after using the scroll wheel!"

string(414) "It's a tried and true design that's beloved by many productivity focused professionals. Personally, I don't see the need for the silent click; it's definitely less satisfying when clicking.

Also, I find it irritating that they changed the dongle and made it incompatible with the previous generation models. 

Regardless, it's an excellent mouse for productivity. It's just not much of an upgrade vs. MX Master 3."


string(1161) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech MX Master 3S is One of the best sculpt mouses available in the market today. It is a very solid mouse with high quality thumb scroll wheel and it is very easy to spin around. The main scrollwheel has also been made quieter, and somehow even more fun to use. However; the scroll has been very smooth and super responsive. I adjusted the default scroll speed to high as I would like to scroll faster. One thing i have noticed is that the scroll wheel has not been super silent, especially during ratcheting mode. Ergonomically perfect, very comfortable to use and play with. 

The mouse works on pretty much all kinds of surfaces, can easily connect to 3 devices, and can connect by using bluetooth or a USB dongle. The one thing I haven’t figured out yet is, when installing the custom profiles so that the mouse switches behavior based on the application you are using. 

I wouldn’t think this mouse would possibly suit gamers. This is a great mouse for daily users, professionals.I have a MacBook for work and this works great with my Mac at my office.

This mouse is as close to ideal as it gets. Amazingly precise sensor that is tracking at 8k DPI resolution and able to work on most surfaces, scroll wheel with ability to unlock it for "free wheeling" and scroll thru huge documents and customizable side wheel, side buttons and a thumb button! Side buttons can be programmed for a standard Forward/Back in browsers to Audio Mute/UnMute + Camera On/Off in teleconferencing applications. Thumb button combines with the mouse movement so you can decide what happens when you press it and then move up, down and side to side.
Battery life is impressive - I've used this mouse for a week of everyday work - had not have to charge it yet. Charging is done via the USB-C port and allows you to continue working.
Software - mouse is configurable via Logitech Option Plus (not the older Logitech Options) and Options Plus is not compatible with the previous generation devices so you might need both until you upgrade all gear. Same goes for a receiver - it's a new kind (not a Unifying receiver anymore) so you may need both or just use this mouse in a Bluetooth connectivity mode.

Overall - I'm loving it, no wrist pain, super sensitive, comfortable and VERY quiet! No mouse click sound, but still have a great tactile feedback."

string(2149) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you've worked with any of the previous versions of this mouse, you know that they fit your hand like a glove--assuming you're right-handed at least. The 3S is no difference. It fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. The two main buttons and scroll wheel feel great. The horizontal scroll wheel and button on the left where your thumb rests are all within reach for the one finger. 

The largest upgrade from the previous version of this mouse has to be, hands down, the clicking noise - or lack thereof! The difference is night and day! This new mouse is so incredibly quiet when clicking the right and left buttons. It's advertised at 90% quieter, and I believe it! If you're in a quiet room, especially with a partner studying or something, the reduced clicking noise alone will save you from ugly looks from them.

The tracking sensor on the 3S is rated at 8,000 DPI, which is double that of the pervious version. While I cannot say that I've noticed any difference, twice the rated performance is cool to know. Not only does it provide even better, more precise tracking of movement, but it also helps performance over a wide variety of surfaces. I have a mixed material desk (wood and glass). While the mouse is always on a mouse pad, I have tried it on the clear glass surface and it worked just fine.

Connect this mouse up to three devices via Bluetooth or the included USB dongle. The mouse does have a USB-C port for charging, so you can use your own cable or the included USB-A to -C cable.

The software allows you to customize the various buttons on the mouse and enhance its capabilities on both Mac and Windows. The software also allows you to seamlessly switch between screens with Logitech Flow (a software feature). I've used it on my desktop and laptop and works okay, I guess. It's just not how I work, but it's there if you really want to take advantage of it.

If you already own the MX 3, I wouldn't say the upgrade is worth it. If you're coming from a 2S or earlier version, or are looking for an incredible mouse, then I would absolutely recommend the MX Master 3S."


string(5310) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech’s MX Master 3s mouse represents the pinnacle of the MX series mice.  It offers refinement in materials, buttons, noise, connectivity, and ergonomics that set it apart from its predecessors.  As a long time fan of the MX series this mouse tops the Master/Performance series by a good margin.

First of all, I’ll lead with the fact that Logitech has gone a long way to making their packaging more environmentally friendly.  Practically all the packaging was made of cardboard that’s easily recyclable instead of the “I’m going to cut you” plastic of yesteryear.  I appreciate this movement, and it means I can recycle or keep the box.  The mouse itself feels even more durable and the materials in use feel like this mouse will last a good long while.  While it does not include a user serviceable battery, I can attest that my 10 year old Performance MX can hold enough charge to be useful to this day, so I’m not concerned about this mouse becoming e-waste.

Now, a few things to know about this mouse: It’s a continuation of the original MX Performance mouse, but really it’s a reimagined MX Master 3.  The Master 3s adds a new 8K sensor, super quiet buttons and an even quieter scroll wheel without messing with the existing ergonomics and connectivity already associated with the MX Master 3.  If you have a Master 3, you may not want to upgrade, but if you’re an OG or Master 2 mouse user, this is a worthy upgrade for sure.  Included in the box is a Bolt receiver which can be used with the first channel, and the other two channels can use Bluetooth (or another receiver).  Finally a USB-C to USB-A cable is included for charging.

Speaking of charging, Logitech claims 3 hours of use from a single minute of charging.  70 days is possible from a full charge.  While I can’t verify those claims, almost a week of use hasn’t dented the battery significantly.  USB-C charging means this guy is pretty universally chargeable.  One thing I noticed is that it didn’t seem to be able to operate as a wired mouse when plugged in (and no receivers or connections).

If you’re new to the MX Series, what really sets these mice apart is the scroll wheel.  Designed to be able to flick through an Excel spreadsheet at lightning speed (Logitech claims 1000 lines per second), the free spinning scroll wheel was an experiment that really did catch on with those that adopted the performance MX.  Originally a click in on the scroll wheel would change between free scrolling and clicky, but the later Master mice swapped to an automatic trigger (although the button right behind the wheel swaps modes).  If you scroll with enough force, the clicky scrolling gives way to free scrolling.  The MagSpeed scroll wheel is unique and functional.  This, combined with the larger shape, and plethora of buttons is what made the MX Performance/Master mice popular amongst business/software professionals.

With the MX Master a horizontal scroll wheel was added, and this eventually turned into a more prominent feature.  While some pros do use the horizontal scroll wheel to move about in their enormous excel spreadsheets, I love Logitech’s Options+ software.  Not only can I set the primary feature to be volume control, in which the horizontal scroll wheel's heavy weighted feel is quite natural at, but the software also installs profiles: for instance in chrome, I can simply swap tabs using the horizontal scroll wheel, or use it for zoom in a powerpoint presentation.

Another big feature that’s unique to the MX series is the darkfield sensor.  While Logitech has dropped the marketing wording around it, it’s still quiet the achievement in laser technology.  The ability to track on glass is still not the most universal feature, and this mouse basically will track on any surface pretty accurately.  

The big differentiator for the 3s is the quiet click buttons.  It delivers its promise.  While being nearly inaudible, the buttons still maintain a satisfying click feel. Logitech made sure every button had this feel, which is a nice touch.  The thumb base button also feels quite soft.  I was impressed that button included gestures for multi-tasking that map very naturally into Windows 10/11 and Mac OS.

Speaking of, the Logitech MX Master 3s fits right in a Mac environment.  Logitech Options+ software works well on both Mac and Windows and enables things like Flow, which can transfer text, images, and even files between computers.  It even allows swapping between computers by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen.  Logitech has really done an amazing job nailing the software, as Flow is super slick.

Overall the MX Master 3s is a refinement upon several refinements.  I’ve long been a fan of these mice, and despite what some may say, I’ve successfully played twitch shooters on these mice for years to great effect.  The ability to trace anywhere is one of my favorite features.  I’ve been a long time user of the smaller Anywhere MX series, but this full size MX feels more natural than any of the other full size MX mice I’ve used in the past (Performance MX, Master MX).  For productivity, it’s hard to imagine a better mouse.  Logitech continues to deliver the best mice in the industry."


string(3772) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The MX Master 3S is my new favorite mouse for work. It’s extremely comfortable to use, has solid performance over Bluetooth or Logi Bolt, the side scroll wheel has a lot of convenient uses, and the battery lasts long enough that I never have to worry about charging. For productivity focused work it feels like the peak.

Getting into the box, you get the mouse, a charging cable, and a Logi Bolt receiver. It should be noted the Logi Bolt receiver is somewhat new and not compatible with older Logitech devices that used the Unifying receiver. Something to keep in mind if you are already using other Logitech devices with an existing receiver. I set the mouse up first using the Logi Bolt receiver and the mouse appears to be pre-paired to it out of the box, so there was nothing for me to do but plug it into an existing USB-A port. Running the setup through the Logi Options+ software I was able to make assignments on each button and set up application-specific profiles. It is unfortunate that the Logi Options+ software isn’t compatible with all of Logitech’s mice and keyboards; currently I still need to use the older Logitech Options for my K680 keyboard.

I’ve been using the MX Master 3S for a couple of weeks now and have used it as my primary work mouse for about a week. I’ve used it interchangeably over Bluetooth and with the Logi Bolt receiver in a relatively crowded office environment and the performance has been flawless in both cases. I cannot really point to a difference in using the mouse with the Bolt receiver or over Bluetooth. I think I might notice a little bit less latency over Bolt, but the difference is almost imperceptible. The first thing I noticed was how comfortable it was. It feels like it’s perfectly sculpted for my hand and the soft-touch plastic helps a lot as well. The side scroll wheel feels well positioned and I don’t have to strain my hand to get to it. The main scroll wheel feels similar to the MX Anywhere 3 and transitions seamlessly from stepping scrolling to free-wheeling and it felt really easy to dial in exactly the speed I wanted for the email or document I was working on. The primary left and right click buttons are very quiet, but there’s a tactileness to them that never makes me question whether or not I’ve clicked. With the software installed, the mouse will automatically switch profiles for applications you have loaded, which I think might work well for some people, but for me it was a little jarring to have the side scroll wheel flipping between tabs on Chrome only to then be adjusting volume or changing cells somewhere else. Thankfully, this is easy to turn off. There is also a button on the thumb rest that opens up some gesture controls. I didn’t get much use out of the gesture controls myself, but they work well enough. The cursor tracks smoothly across a variety of surfaces, though I can’t say I noticed too much of a difference turning the 8K sensor mode on. The standard mode (which is what the previous MX Master 3 has) is probably what most would use I’d imagine.

The battery life has been excellent for me. I’ve used it for several full days and not seen the percentage drop at all. It’s quoted at 70 days by Logitech and I’m inclined to believe that. It’s certainly long enough that charging is never really on my mind.

Before the MX Master 3S I was using the MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. I like that mouse a lot and ergonomics are important to me, but I’m considering switching to the MX Master 3S full time now just for the sheer amount of productivity features it gets me.It’s no gaming mouse and if you’re a lefty you’re out of luck, but for work I haven’t used anything better."


string(1074) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Logitech MX Master 3S is a great Mouse that you can take anywhere and it will work with up to 3 different devices which is a welcome versatile feature.

First thing I did after taking the Logitech MX Master 3S out of the box was charge it with the included USB C cord, and Logitech claims the battery will last up to 70 days which is more than enough lasting power for me, if I get a month or so I’ll be happy. Time will tell.

The Logitech MX Master 3S comes with an included Logi Bolt Bluetooth receiver but I didn’t need to use it for any of my devices. 

I paired my Logitech MX Master 3S with my MacBook, a Windows Gaming Laptop and an iPad Pro and once paired switching and working with different devices back and forth was seamless.

The Logitech MX Master 3S is fully customizable if using the Logi Options+ software which is available for PC and Mac.

Scrolling is smooth and overall operation of the Logitech MX Master 3S is fantastic.

The Logitech MX Master 3S is my go to Mouse for all my devices now."


string(2002) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve owned many logi mice over the years, and they tend to be my go to brand for work and school. I wanted this mouse for my work from home setup, in lieu of the wired one provided to me. As always out of the box it was an easy setup, you really can just plug in and go for basic features. Had no problems with my work laptop connecting once I put the provided USB into it. First thing I noticed was how incredibly quiet it was while right, or left clicking. The Quiet Click feature is literally silent, and I can say I’ve never experienced such a genuinely quiet mouse click. The next thing I noticed was the scroll wheel, which is advertised as Magspeed, and once again something I’ve never seen before. The way it smoothly, and quickly can spin in a full rotation off of one stroke of the finger is super impressive. There are plenty of customizable options literally at your fingertips which I feel a lot of people will appreciate. The design is sleek, and visually appealing. 

The cons for me was although Logitech advertises a track glass, 8K dpi sensor that will work on any surface, that wasn’t the case for me. I have a gaming mousepad that spans my entire desk, and it literally felt like a workout moving the mouse around, despite the previous one by logi I used had no issues. I don’t want to have to rearrange my setup, just to accommodate this mouse. Also, it wasn’t as comfortable in my hand, and after only 10 minutes of use I felt some discomfort. I’m not sure if it was from having to exert so much energy to move the mouse around, or the design, but I feel both. The thumb pad is a nice ergonomic feature, but it just was not as comfortable to me in hand and I cannot use this everyday, for 8 hours at work which was disappointing. Maybe this would be better for other people, with different ergonomic needs than I. Overall, I would recommend this to the right person, and right setup, but may not work for everyone."


string(1171) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech has long been known for quality PC mice and keyboards and the MX Master 3S does not disappoint. It balances style and comfort, looking great on the desk while comfortable in your hand. 

The Logitech MX Master 3S connects to the PC using either Bluetooth or a small USB device called the Logitech Bolt receiver. Most laptops will have Bluetooth and even many desktops and so that’s likely your preferred method of connecting.

If using a PC that doesn’t support Bluetooth you can use the supplied Logitech Bolt USB receiver. Note that this is the traditional style USB-A and not the more recent USB-C. Arguably this is understandable as more devices still use the older style USB ports so it increases compatibility, especially with devices that do not support Bluetooth.

Charging the mouse is done with the supplied USB-A to USB-C cable and it charges quickly. One nice feature is that the port on the mouse is on the front and so it can be used while the device is charging. 

Overall, if you’re looking for a great mouse for home, work or school, this is an excellent option that will not disappoint."


string(550) "The MX Mechanical keyboard uses Bolt so that forced an upgrade from my Master 3 to the 3S. It's an incremental improvement. I don't do precision mouse work so much of the improvement is lost on me. Still, much like the Master 3 it's a great mouse. You'll notice a bigger difference between the 2S and 3S, not least going from microUSB charging to USB-C. Being able to easily switch between multiple computers is useful for me and works very well. If you're looking to replace the cheap wired mouse that came with your computer the 3S is a no brainer."


string(1929) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After 3 years of heavy usage, I was able to upgrade from the Master 3 as my main mouse (which is now my travel mouse) to the Master 3s. Though the look of the mouse is practically identical to its predecessor, the mechanical upgrade does make a big difference. 

One of the biggest pain points from the Master 3 was how loud the clicking noise was. As a designer, I do click a lot and it was the most annoying thing to other people. When you're clicking away in an isolated room, it probably doesn't matter as much but if you're next to someone using the mouse as a designer - its pretty distracting. I didn't realize until a colleague commented on it. But with the Master 3s, I was blown away how quiet the clicking was. 

There's also more sensor sensitivity options for those with higher resolution screens, I usually set mine at 1800 DPI,you can set it up to 8k max.

Same as its predecessor, you can easily switch between different devices and adjust the settings of the horizontal/vertical scrolls, and other buttons depending on the program you're using through the Logi options app. Which as a designer, I fully take advantage of programing zooming in/out for the scrolling, copy/paste buttons and much more. 

Maybe because the mouse is newer the side scroll has a little more friction when scrolling which I personally like more. 

The design of the mouse allows my full hand to rest comfortably on the entire mouse. This essentially ruins me when I try to use the traditional mouse that is less comfortable and makes me long for my logitech master 3s.

The only downfall is the USB-A bolt receiver, as it is incompatible with the other logitech devices and I would have to use a USB-A to C converter. Waiting on logitech to finally give us the USB-c. But overall no connection issues with the receiver or through Bluetooth.

Overall, logitech never fails to deliver."


string(1057) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great mouse.  I also have a MX Master 3 which is almost the same, and find it super comfortable in my hand.

Super convenient since I have multiple computers connected to the same monitor and keyboard setup as well.                                                     
                                                                                                                                                  
The side thumb roller wheel is great for panning large Excel files or CAD drawings.  Top roller wheel smooth as well.  Great battery life, and easy to connect to a charge cord and still use like an "old-time" wired mouse.
                                                                                                                                                   
Definitely recommend!"


string(180) "It is crazy how quiet this mouse is.  Never realized how load normal mouse clicks are.  This is like a stealth mouse so quiet.  Love how fast it is and how it can go on any surface"


string(364) "This is probably the best mouse that I have ever used. I use a mouse everyday and was starting to notice that my wrist was starting to hurt more than normal. I decided to purchase this because how how well it fit into my hand. After using it a couple of days now, I can feel a difference from using a mouse that caused me pain to a mouse that I can’t stop using!"

string(195) "A worthwhile upgrade to a mouse that was already among the best.  The fact that it can work properly on more surfaces and has a lower click noise makes it perfect for working anywhere you may be."


string(129) "Upgraded from a MX Master 3 and found this to be more appropriate for a workplace. Extremely quiet clicks and great polling rate."


string(68) "Very nice mouse. Excellent upgrade compared to the previous version."


string(760) "Very similar to the 3.  The 3S is Logi Bolt compatible and NOT Unifying Receiver compatible.  As of today, these are two completely separate and similar technology.  Bolt is newer, more secure and can be trained up to 3 separate Bolt receivers.  The Master Keys Mini is also Bolt compatible.   

The quiet clicking is something that I do enjoy better and I also prefer Bolt as that's what my peripherals are moving towards.  Do not expect a night and day difference to Master MX 3.   I have not been able to see a difference when it comes to the benefits of the higher PPI tracker.

I have very large hands, and this is very comfortable to me.   People with smaller hands may find it too large.  This is a right-handed product... lefties should look elsewhere."

string(423) "Solid mouse. Coming from an MX Master 2S there are some small changes but overall the same mouse. Software is intuitive and build quality feels solid. Gesture button does feel a bit spongy and have yet to see how the gesture button holds up over time considering historical issues with the gesture button "sticking" on the 2S. Silent clicks are a welcome addition. Overall, a solid purchase if it holds up in the long term."


string(3266) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech doesn't need any introduction and I have been an avid user of Logitech computer accessories for as long as I can remember. I have been working as a Mechanical Design Engineer for more than 10 years now and Logitech is the only brand that I use for my mouse. I spend 90% of my time at job using mouse to 3D design stuff on software such as Creo, NX and SolidWorks. I cannot even imagine using any other brand mouse. I started with G602 that had 9 programmable buttons and anyone with even a little design experience can understand how much of a life saver that mouse is. Unfortunately, that started giving some issues after more than 5 years of service and I replaced it with MX Master 2S and OMG, that was a game a changer too. I agree, it didn't have as much programmable buttons but I still was able to make full use of few that are provided.

The MX Master 2S was a fantastic mouse, but I had two complaints about it: 1) It used Micro USB instead of Type C and 2) the thumb wheel and navigation buttons were hard to use. The MX Master 3S fixes both those problems. The thumb wheel now has a very high quality feel to it and is very easy to spin around, and they've moved the navigation buttons lower down to make them easier to press with your thumb. The main scroll wheel has also been made quieter, and somehow even more fun to use. As before, this mouse works on pretty much all surfaces, can connect to 3 devices, and can connect by either bluetooth or a USB dongle. I've had no issues using it on both a Mac and PC. Logitech claims a battery life of 70 days, and while I obviously haven't been able to test that out yet, if the MX Master 2S is anything to go by, you can expect great battery life on this mouse too. The 3S has significantly better placement for my average sized hands. On the 2S, it required pulling my thumb so far back, that it initially felt like my thumb was going to dislocate. On the 3S that isn’t a problem.

The vertical scroll wheel is great. Feels much better than the scroll wheel on the 2S, but it may take some fiddling with the Logitech Options program to get it to automatically switch to free scrolling based on your desired speed. The default setting switches it too easily, and the jump from ratcheted scrolling to free scrolling speed is significant. You might find yourself wanting to just scroll a few lines faster, and then suddenly you’re all the way at the bottom of a webpage.

It's a big upgrade from Master 2S. However, if you own a Master 3, getting a 3S would not be much of an upgrade for you. The only difference between the two are that 3S has a 8000 DPI sensor where as 3 has 4000 DPI sensor. The other difference is that Logitech claims that 3S has 90% quieter clicking than 3.

There is no question the placement of the back and forward buttons has been improved as well as the horizontal scrolling wheel as compared to 2S. The tracking also seems more precise. The gesture button is also vastly improved and now has an actual physical button. This mouse unequivocally earns a high five stars rating from me, along with my honest and very hearty recommendation. You will never see a mouse more ergonomic and comfortable to use than this one!"


string(2772) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the original MX Master since it came out a few years ago as my daily driver for work. I have also skipped the past versions as well. So, on first impressions, the fundamental design remains almost the same. It is still for right-handed people, the thumb rests comfortable on the rubber “winglet”, it promotes a “palm rest” use, and has similar weight. There are also significant changes. The side-scroll wheel is larger, the back-forward buttons are now below it, and the scroll wheel is larger and all metal. I will say that I do prefer the back-forward buttons on the side as they seem a bit out of place under the side-wheel. The right-left buttons are smaller but are pushed forward a bit more and the right one protrudes further. I had to get used to it, but it only took a few hours before things became second nature. Overall, I find the ergonomics comfortable for my medium-sized hands.

I tried connecting via USB-C wired, Bluetooth, and the included 2.4Ghz receiver across a Windows laptop, an iOS tablet, and an Android tablet. All connected properly with no issues.  Switching between them is a breeze by pressing the buttons below the mouse. According to Logitech, the battery life can last for 70 days, and it seems that this may be true since I’ve been using it for days and it still shows up as full. Plus, the mouse features quick-charging where 1 minute provides 3 hours of use -very nice!

The buttons and wheels are very responsive, and I am grateful that they are very quiet -useful while late night browsing! The underside allows for easy gliding across several surfaces (hard or soft). The mouse is easy to pick up and drop easily as well. While I might not be fully sold on the placement of the forward-back buttons, they make it easy to move between web pages. Since I work heavily with spreadsheets and data, the MagSpeed scroll wheel is of great benefit. The same goes with the side-scroll wheel. Managing long websites, text, and video editing becomes so much easier. 

Just in case the stock settings do not do it for you, Logitech provides the Logi Options app, where you can easily customize the buttons, add macros, adjust the gesture button and scroll wheels specific to the software or program, and even device being used. I especially appreciate changing the DPI. There you can manage all compatible Logi devices as well. 

At the end of the end Logitech has got a great thing going with the MX Master series. While there’s nothing wrong with the original, I am glad that now the MX Master 3s features USB-C, great battery life, and super quiet buttons. It may be pricier than other options, but what it brings to the table is well worth it in my opinion."


string(3131) "Finally - All the features of MX series with softer clicks and newer wireless tech, and improved tracking on shiny/glass surfaces!

I'm already a BIG fan of the MX series, owning a full-size MX Mechanical keyboard and a separate Craft keyboard for my second workstation at my desk (for my creative work!). I also have both an MX Master 3 and an MX Vertical mouse, and the MX Anywhere portable mouse for travel (spoiler alert, I'm a Logitech peripheral fan!). 

Alas, I loved the MX series, but the MX Master 3 (and the MX Master and MX Master 2 I owned before it) all suffered from very loud click sounds from the primary left and right mouse buttons. Some people like the click, but those people aren't married to my wife! :)

The MX Master 3S is the perfect companion to my new MX Mechanical keyboard - Its smoothness doesn't disappoint. ALL of the MX Master features are here, including customizability, scrolling control (choice between stopped/clutched and smooth scrolling and compatibility with Logitech's own receiver format, and bluetooth PCs, tablets, phones and other compute devices.

There are a few quirks as well, mostly due to a generational leap that Logitech is making across the MX series starting with the Master 3S and MX Mechanical:

 - This mouse is NOT compatible with Logitech's UNIFYING receivers that they've been including with peripherals for YEARS now. They have upgraded it to a new technology called Logitech BOLT which will replace UNIFYING in their lineup. BOLT has some technical advantages, such as reduced USB bandwidth and I believe better coverage/reduced latency but this will disappoint those who are only upgrading one peripheral and expected backwards compatibility with their other desktop components. BOLT is the new UNIFYING at Logi, but you'll need to upgrade everything to take advantage. BOLT devices can't work with a UNIFYING receiver, and UNIFYING compatible devices won't work with a BOLT receiver. Its a lose-lose on compatibility. Thankfully Bluetooth is Bluetooth and supports all, but if you use the receivers, you'll need two to support mixed old/new standards.

 - Just as with the hardware, the software is being replaced also- Gone is support for Logitech Options, the keyboard and mouse customization software for the rest of the MX series, to be replaced by Logitech Options+, which gets nary a mention on their Options website. I spent about 30 minutes troubleshooting how I had the latest version of Options and STILL couldn't see my MX Master 3S in its configuration screen. The good news here is that Options+ DOES support many of the older MX series items also, so upgrading to it in a mixed estate should be no problem.

All in all this is a generational change, which will delight some and infuriate others, but I'm so happy to have this device, as well as the rest of the EXCELLENT MX Series, in the stable. I loved it so much I went out and added an MX Mechanical to the set (which I will review separately) just to have everything on my station on BOLT and Options+ and to take advantage of its improvements. The new MX Series devices are worthy of the name!"


string(1580) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech has pretty much cornered the market for excellent quality mice, trackballs and keyboards. I can't really think of any other brand to consider when I'm in the market for one of these devices. And, this holds true for the latest MX Master 3S mouse. I normally use a trackpad with my Mac, but wanted to give the Logitech mouse a spin. The build quality is excellent and the configurability options are almost endless. You can literally change every button and the scroll wheels to do almost anything you want when picking from a very long list of possibilities. Although the default options for each button/scroll wheel make the most sense, I changed a few to suit my needs and workflow better. The only real issue I had and I have with any of these Logitech products is the software. It tends to be a bit buggy, especially at the time of original installation. I already had Logitech Options installed on my Mac, but to use this mouse ones needs Options+. The Options software told me I needed to update to Options+, but didn't tell me how. Any other software will have an "update" option in one of the drop down menus, but Options did not. After about 15 minutes of trying to figure out what to do, I finally realized I just need to go the website and download the latest version of regular Options after which I would be guided to update to Options+. None of that made any sense, but I finally got it figured out. However, I can imagine someone who is not as techy as me would probably need to contact Logitech support."


string(1985) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Summary: Probably the best mouse I have ever owned. It has outstanding customization features for major productivity products (Office, Adobe, etc), great ergonomics and high quality build.

Pros:
Build quality
Comfort
Performance
Style
Ease of use
Customization
Battery life
Bluetooth or USB wireless
Cons:
Dongle is USB-A only

Unboxing / setup:
The package is small and has the essentials, the mouse, a dongle (USB-A) and warranty info. Setup is easy. With the dongle you can just plug it into the system and the mouse is automatically paired. If you want to connect via bluetooth, long press the connection button on the bottom and pair via your computer. I highly recommend you install the Logitech software from the website as it will allow you to customize buttons/wheels with specific programs such as excel, photoshop and more.

Build quality:
The quality of this device is outstanding. It uses some sort of magnetic scrolling so the wheels feel buttery smooth. Button clicks are good and the device feels sturdy.

Use: 
I test with a windows laptop, a Mac Mini and a Galaxy Tab 8 Ultra in Dex mode. All devices are easily supported or paired to the mouse. The PC and mac allow for 8k DPI mode which for me was a bit too fast but for some will allow insane amounts of accuracy. The scroll wheels are very useful, especially the horizontal wheel. On Mac it is great for scrolling through books, magazines and more whereas in productivity software it is great for navigation on spreadsheets, moving around zoomed photos and so on. The thumb rest area has a hidden button that you can use for multiple things. I use it for selection between open windows similar to alt-tab. 

Bluetooth seemed a little laggy to me in comparison to using the dongle but it was still useful. The USB-A dongle was a non issue for me but if you are using this with a device that is only equipped with USB-C this might be an issue without an adapter."


string(4075) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m very experienced with the MX Master Mouse (having owned the original MX Master), which worked perfectly on Windows.  I recently bought a brand-new MacBook Pro M1 Pro with the Silicon ARM Chip, and I also bought the MX Master 3 Mouse.  Unfortunately, the Logitech Options software you download in order to program the mouse didn’t work with the MacBook Pro, which was a major disappointment.  Until just recently, Logitech still hadn’t optimized the Intel based software for the Logitech Options App (the app you use to program functionality on the mouse) to run on the Silicone ARM technology of a MacBook Pro, so sadly, even with Logitech Technical support help, I had to return it. 

To Logitech’s credit, days after returning the mouse they sent me an updated link they said would work with an MX Master 3 on a Silicon ARM Based MacBook Pro. I stored the link hoping I’d get another opportunity to use a MX Master.  That day came when I got the newest MX Master 3s.  So, did it work?  Yes, yes it did!  Using the updated Logitech Options Installer, it installed perfectly, and I was able to program the mouse to my specific needs.  To say I’m a Happy Camper is an understatement.

Now that I’ve gotten the pre-story out of the way, let’s talk about this mouse.  If you’ve never had the pleasure of owning a Logitech MX Master Mouse, you simply have no idea what you’re missing.  It may seem odd to wax enthusiastic over a mouse, but the MX Master is worthy of such praise.  And this newest MX Master 3s even more so.

It’s now even more ergonomic.  It just fits your hand so perfectly.  It’s made of premium plastics (recycled to save the planet) and this version doesn’t show fingerprints.  They come with a battery which lasts a LONG time.  A very LONG time.  The new MX Master 3s can go up to 70 days on a single charge.  My original MX Master lasted a long time as well, so I have every expectation the 3s will live up to what Logitech claims.

You need to go to Logitech.com and download the Logitech Options App. It is very easy to use and lets you customize so many aspects of the mouse.  You can change the pointer speed.  You can Program the second scroll wheel on the side of the mouse.  I use it as volume up and down.  You have two buttons underneath the second scroll wheel, which I have programmed as forward and back.  And there’s yet another button where your thumb rests, which I’ve set up for Universal Control.  You can choose from many other options to suit your workflow.

The primary scroll wheel is magical.  There’s the traditional mouse click we’re all used to.  And a tap of the button behind the wheel, releases what Logitech calls Magspeed.  The wheel is magnetic and has no, none, zip friction.  You can scroll faster than you’ve ever scrolled before.  And the scroll wheel also can be clicked and programmed for a number of functions.  I have mine programmed to zoom, which is very cool.

The mouse can be paired with up to three different devices and all you need to do is tap the pairing button on the bottom of the mouse to switch between paired devices.  This mouse can scan up to 8000 DPI, for ultra-smooth and accurate scrolling.  The mouse can connect with Windows, Chrome, Linux, iPadOS , Android and MacOS.  And if you don’t have Bluetooth, it does come with a USB Receiver.  One of the best upgrades over previous MX Master Mice is how unbelievably quiet the 3s is.  You can’t hear the wheels scroll.  More importantly, you can’t hear the right or left mouse clicks.  How refreshing to have a mouse which does so much, yet so incredibly quiet.  

If you haven’t gathered from what I’ve written, I’m quite enamored with the Logitech MX Master 3s.  They took everything that was already good in previous MX Master Mice and improved it significantly.  And now, I’m able to use it on a MacBook Pro M1 Pro Silicon ARM Based laptop.  Is it worth the price of admission?  Yes, yes it is.  Just get one.  You simply won’t regret it."


string(172) "Love the 8000 DPI, definitely noticeable.  Other than that it’s pretty much the same as it’s previous version. The 8000 DPI made it worth it to upgrade to this version."


string(2085) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This has got to be the most comfortable mouse I have ever used.  It may cost well above the price of your typical, run-of-the-mill regular mouse, but it is well worth it.  When they say "ultrafast scrolling" they mean it.  No more zig-zagging up and down and left and right all over the place next to your keyboard.  You just move the mouse a small distance and the cursor is there, just where you want it, in a fraction of the time.  The scrolling and movement, both on the screen and physically with the mouse, is as smooth as butter.  


The ergonomics of the mouse is superb.  I am not exaggerating when I say that it is so comfortable.  The soft, rubbery-feeling thumb rest placement combined with the natural curvature of the mouse itself makes for an almost cloud-like, pillowy feel when you place your hand upon it.  It's not too tall, not too short.  The customizable buttons, both on the side by the thumb rest and on top, are in perfect placement, as are the scroll wheels.  


And the sound--the clicking is virtually silent, it's so quiet.  You do get the satisfying click sound so you know the click was registered, but it is very subtle.  It pairs via Bluetooth or USB receiver; I utilized Bluetooth pairing, which was seamless and quick.  It also charges via a USB-A to USB-C charging cable that is included--no messing around with batteries.  I tried this mouse with several of my own devices as well as others' in my household--my iMac and iPads, my husband's Samsung and ASUS laptops, my kids' Dell and Chromebook laptops and desktops, etc.  All the different operating systems and web browsers worked well with this mouse, as did the switching between devices.  (So I could switch seamlessly between my iMac and iPad, or from our Dell desktop to one of our laptops, etc.  It can be paired simultaneously with up to three devices.)  


Among the several mice we've had over the years, from different brands and different kinds and at different price points, this is definitely one of the best.  Highly recommended."


string(1239) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the original MX Master mouse for a handful of years.  I use it daily, especially since working from home for the past couple years.  It is not a high-performance gaming mouse.  It does not have 15,000 dpi, a sub 60g weight, or on-the-fly dpi switching.  What it does have is incredible battery life, ergonomics, and the best scroll wheel I have ever used.  This new 3S model takes everything I love about daily driving the MX Master for work, and adds to it.  Button presses still have a positive bump, but the switches are near silent.  No more click-clacking around a spreadsheet.  The buttons are super quiet.  The shape has changed a bit and does not feel as wide as my original MX, but it is still every bit as comfortable.  It's a joy to use on a daily basis, with a good weight for productivity tasks.  It's a heavier mouse, but again this is not an ultralight gaming mouse, which is fine.  Also, this new model charges via USB-C instead of the micro-USB on the older model, which is always a welcome change.  Overall I would highly recommend this new MX model for anybody looking for a high quality comfortable mouse that does not need to be charged very often."


string(1608) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you're familiar with the MX Master line of mice, then this will be entirely familiar. It was already a good product, but Logitech has still managed to find way to tweak the design. First, the Logo Options + software is now out of beta, and the minor issues have been fixed. Besides giving you enhanced ability to redefine what each button does, the software also allows you to assign functions to buttons depending on which app you're currently using. So, for example, the side scroll wheel could switch between tabs in your browser but scroll side to side in your Excel workbooks. The main applications that come with preset tailored functions are Chrome, Edge, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, and Word, but you can add just about any application on your computer for customized settings. The main scroll wheel still does its thing where it will sense when you're trying to scroll a lot and start to spin freely for extended scrolling. You can also turn that "clicking" off and on for the scroll wheel just by clicking it, but I found that it still scrolls in small jumps on the screen, so I prefer to leave those magnetic "clicks" on for regular use. I also really appreciate the presence of that side scroll wheel over having to use buttons or push the center scroll wheel side to side. It's just better ergonomically. And overall, the ergonomics of the mouse are still superb. The main left and right click buttons are quieter, as advertised, but I'm not sure how important that really is. If you haven't updated your mouse in awhile, this is good option."


string(1592) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used every iteration of the MX Master series mice and was looking forward to getting this newest version. It definitely does not disappoint, and I highly recommend this mouse.
Packaging is typical for Logitech and refreshingly simple.  It comes with the mouse, USC C charging cable and the Logi Bolt USB receiver (I have never needed this for any version of this mouse as I connect via Bluetooth).
The only issue I came across was with setting this mouse up.  I had been using the MX master 2S mouse for a year and it connected immediately.  This one took about 20 minutes as my 3 month $2700 laptop would not pair with the product. I then tried to connect through the Logi Options software but came to find out this mouse needed a different software called Logi Options + in order to unwrap all the great features, assign buttons, etc. Had to remove Logi Options, install Logi Options +, then reboot and then it connected quickly. It would have been nice to know it needed a different software from the beginning – would have saved a lot of time.  
Operation of this mouse is flawless and unbelievably works on ANY surface, even a clear glass top table. Programming the buttons through the software was simple and of course you can change the speeds of the cursor movement as well as the 2 buttons near the thumb under the thumb scroll to your liking.  Ergonomically, this is the best feeling, most comfortable mouse of the MX series. 
Overall – I highly recommend this mouse as it does what it touts and does it extremely well."


string(1856) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Truly one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used. I've been using Logitech's MX Master Mouse 2 for a few years now, and I've had nothing but good experience with it. This updated version is no different. The first thing that really jumps out at you is just how quiet it is. While you may not necessarily think about how loud mouse clicks are, this mouse will make you realize just how loud they used to be. Each click feels great but is very quiet. It's almost inaudible. That's not to say that there's any question as to whether you've clicked though, it is still very easy to tell when you've clicked the buttons, they're just almost silent. The material of the mouse is very nice too. It has an almost soft touch feel that's very nice. That along with the quietness gives the mouse a very premium feel. The position of the side wheel has taken a little getting used to, as I was so used to the MX Master Mouse 2, and this one is positioned a bit higher it seems. If you've used an MX Master before, you'll know they also have this great feature of where you can kind of spin the middle mouse button wheel quickly and it will switch from a click-y type of scrolling to a free-moving wheel for quicker scrolling. This new one has the same option, but again, the operation of the switch between types is very quiet. It has other great features too, like being able to connect to 3 different devices and quickly switching between them. Logitech's software for customizing the mouse is also great and easy to use. If there is anything that I can maybe complain about with this mouse, is that the soft touch material is kind of a magnet to dust and fuzz.

Pros: Premium feel, extremely quiet, very precise and responsive, great software and customization

Cons: Soft touch can be a magnet for dust/fuzz"


string(2304) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m a big fan of Logitech computer accessories and I have owned a bunch of their MX line of products. I currently use the MX Master 2S and still working great for me. I expect the same from this next generation MX Master and it hasn’t disappointed me.

It now uses USB-C instead of microUSB for charging. The charging port is still located on the front of the mouse so you can use it while it is charging not like the Apple mouse. It lost the 3 LED battery level indicator that was on the 2S which was helpful and it is now replaced with one LED battery indicator. The location of the two side buttons is moved to just under the side scroll wheel. The button click is virtually noiseless. It is that quiet. The scroll wheel in the ratchet mode is also quieter than the previous. It is also faster and more precise.

It works on any surface with the upgraded 8000 DPI sensor compared to the 2S that had 4000 DPI.  You can customize the sensitivity through the app. Whether it be wood, metal, cloth, mousepad or even my glass sliding door, it works on all of those surfaces. The glide strips makes for a very smooth movement across the surface. 

I am using this mouse on Apple devices and they have this feature called Universal Control which lets you use one keyboard and mouse to control your Apple devices simultaneously. With Logitech Options+ and this Flow enabled mouse, you can now control a Mac and Windows computers with one mouse. You can transfer files, copy on one and paste on the other. Wait what? Mac and Windows working together? Yep It’s true! This Logi Flow cross-computer control works pretty seamless too but I think Apple’s Universal Control is more seamless. It still has the ability to connect to three different devices with the easy switch button on the bottom of the mouse

The ergonomic design feels the same as the 2S and the build quality is just as good. The color scheme changed from a gray two tone to a black two tone. The scroll wheels no longer have the rubber outer layer but it doesn’t affect the grip in my opinion. This Master 3S looks and feels great and it works great too.

It comes with a Logi Bolt USB receiver and a USB-A to USB-C cable. This mouse is not compatible with the USB Unifying receiver."

string(1902) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Right off the bat I can honestly say that I recommend this upgraded Logitech MX Master 3S Wireless Laser Mouse with Ultrafast Scrolling being it's made by Logitech.

Inside the package is the new upgraded MX Master 3S mouse, Bolt USB receiver, and USB-C charging cable and user documentation. The Bolt receiver is resemblance to the Unifying Receiver from the last model, however, this connects via Logitech Options+ software and not the regular Logitech Options software. The mouse itself is identical to its older sibling the MX Master 3 Wireless Laser Mouse, that I reviewed a couple years ago. On looks alone, everything looks the same.

Simply pop the Bolt USB Receiver into a free USB port on your laptop/desktop and its ready to go. However, its recommended to download and install the Logitech Options+ software as stated above. This allows you to tweak the settings to your liking. The build quality is solid and sturdy as we've all come to love about Logitech products.

In this upgraded model, Logitech fined tuned an already awesome wireless laser mouse with ultrafast scrolling and made it better. Precision and movement is like buttery smooth. The DPI is now 8000 compared to 4000 and the left and right button clicks are ever so quiet. In the MX Master 3 you can hear and audible click when you press down on the buttons, but on the 3S there's no click sound. This was the first thing I noticed after I got everything installed and loaded. My favorite feature on both the 3 and 3S is that ultrafast flywheel. You can spin that scroll wheel as if you're on The Price is Right, or you can press the button below the scroll wheel and switch the wheel mode into more of a line by line scroll. This mouse can also be connected via Bluetooth instead of the Bolt USB receiver. Bluetooth mode is great for when I want to connect it to my iPad."


string(1117) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Coming from an MX Master 2S, the 3S is a very good upgrade.  The main button action is softer, the scroll wheels are fluid, and the DPI settings are ultrafine and ultrafast...and probably way more than I need.  Overall, the mouse is incredibly comfortable in the hand and button placement is intuitive.  If there is one thing I would love for Logitech to bring back would be a main scroll when that also moves side-to-side.

This is a rechargeable mouse and I'm happy that it includes USB-C for the charging port (as opposed to micro-USB.)

Control of the mouse uses the updated Logi Options +, and I'm happy to see this updated software covers all of the basics in a simpler interface and gives many button/wheel configuration options.  Some older Logitech peripherals are not yet compatible with Options +.

One other thing:  This mouse can connect via Bluetooth or the newer Logi Bolt receiver (as opposed to the Unifying receiver.). I'm not sure it this receiver is backwards compatible, but it appears all of Logitech's newer peripherals are making the switch."


string(1832) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been a fan of logitech mice for quite some time. They are of great quality and work/fit well in almost every scenario, My current m9use is the MX2 Anywhere mouse which is perfect for my on-the-go/work laptop. However, my desktop still needed a quality mouse to use with and this one fit the bill perfectly. 

The ergonomics of this mouse is pretty much perfect for my hands. I have Med/Lrg sized hands so the contours of this mouse just fit great for me and the buttons are all within reach for my fingers. 

Connectivity is pretty standard fare here so you can connect with the USB dongle or via bluetooth. I don't know why but it would be really great if Logitech would incorporate some place to put the USB dongle in the mouse when not in use. Would really mean a lot since I seem to always lose the USB dongle for my other mice. 

Fit/feel of this mouse is great. The L/R buttons are almost silent when pressed and the configurable buttons are well within comfortable reach of your hand. You can program the buttons as you see fit so there's lots of customization there. Scrolling is fantastic with this mouse and customizable as well. 

There is a multi-device connection feature on this mouse however I haven't been able to test it as of yet. With this, you're able to pair the mouse to several different devices, laptops, tablets, etc., and use one mouse across all of them. Sounds like a great idea however, for now, I haven't been able to utilize this feature as of yet. 

Overall, a great mouse for for your needs and especially if you have larger than normal sized hands. The side scrolling button is a bit weird for me only in the sense that I've never had a mouse with this. It'll take some time getting used to but definitely a nice added feature on this mouse."


string(9974) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pros:
-Mouse can be used on virtually any surface, including glass
-Ergonomic; comfortable with any grip
-Very silent
-Pairs with up to 3 devices so you can switch between them (can only use with one device at a time)
-Long battery life
-Very smooth scroll and thumb wheels
-Extremely customizable when used with Logitech's Options+ software
-Logitech Flow allows use of mouse between up to 3 PCs at the same time and copy/paste across them
-8000DPI sensor for quicker movement on high resolution displays

Questionable Pro:
-Uses Bolt receiver, which supposedly provides a more reliable connection

Cons:
-May be jarring to users of the older MX Master series mice at first due to all the changes they made
-Bolt receiver is not backwards compatible and doesn't support Unifying receiver devices
-145Hz polling rate means it's not made for serious gamers
-Flow only compatible with Windows and MacOS
-(for left-handed people) It's a right-handed mouse

Questionable Con:
-Battery indicator is now just one bigger LED, no longer showing levels

For some reason in 2022, Logitech appears to be the only brand with mice on the market that tracks on glass. So if you have a glass table to use your mouse on like I do, and don't want to use a mouse pad, Logitech's MX series of mice appear to be your only option. Thankfully, Logitech does an amazing job with the MX Master line making it feel like a premium device that it's worth.

Thanks to its ergonomic design, it never feels uncomfortable using the MX Master 3S. It's tall enough and curved in the right way to allow your hand and fingers to naturally rest on it. The soft rubberized texture of the base provides a comfortable feel. I've used the mouse all day and my wrist never feels tired from it.

What's new to the MX Master 3S that was absent from the Master MX 3 that preceded it are the silent left and right click buttons. What was once the loudest parts of mouse, on the 3S it's now the most quietest. The amazing thing is, it still feels tactile. It doesn't feel mushy or suppressed. You'll feel the click like you always do. It's just A LOT less noisy. The change is so dramatic that you may hate initially, like I did. I wanted a silent mouse, but when I first used the 3S I instantly felt regret and frustration. My brain was so used to expecting a sound when I click that when I didn't with the 3S it felt extremely jarring to me. I think I may have been clicking harder than I needed to out of reflex. Fortunately, within a half hour, maybe an hour at most, I got used to the silent click and wound up falling in love with it like I thought it would. Oh my GOD, I *WISH* I had this 20 years when I was up using a computer during late hours when my parents expected me in bed.
The left/right click buttons aren't the only thing that's gone quieter. The scroll wheel is also a lot more quiet, even in ratchet mode, where the wheel has tactile "steps" when you spin it.
The back/forward side buttons are also relatively quiet.
All in all this mouse seems to be designed to work quietly. The loudest part of the mouse is probably the thumb button.

None of the buttons feel cheap. They all have a pleasant tactile responsive feel. No soft mushy feel. No sticky feel.
The thumb button is easier to find and on the MX Master 3S than the 2S and older because it has a very slight bump to help feel your way to locating it. It also feels easier to press because there is now a groove on the side of the mouse to allow the button to be pressed deeper. You won't accidentally press it while resting your thumb there because of where the button is placed, in the center of the base of mouse on the left side. It's hard for me to explain. It's not easy to press the button by accident, but it's easy to press the button when you need to.

There are 2 wheels on the mouse, the scroll wheel in between the left/right click buttons for scrolling with your index finger, and the thumb wheel on the side for scrolling with your thumb. There is no longer the rubberized coating on the wheels but they still have a good feel to them. I like this change as I imagine the wheel will be easier to clean over time as it collects dirt and grime. The rubber from the older versions made it tougher to clean as dirt would stick to it. Now it's just all steel.
The thumb scroll wheel is now placed above the back/forward buttons instead of beside them.
Thanks to this, the thumb scroll wheel is in its own row and the wheel is now wider making it more easier to use than ever before.
The scroll wheel has SmartShift, which automatically switches the scroll wheel from line-by-line scrolling to hyper-fast scrolling when you scroll faster.
Or you can use the Shift wheel mode button below the scroll wheel to switch between Ratchet (tactile steps) and Free spin (no tactile steps) immediately.

With the use of Logitech's Options+ software, the mouse is extremely customizable. Every button on the mouse can be remapped. You can even map buttons for specific applications only, instead of making the changes global.
With Options+ you can also change the speed of both wheels, as well as change the direction of the scrolling of the wheels.
You can also change the pointer speed by changing the sensor range. The range is from 200DPI to 8000DPI by steps of 50 DPI. The default DPI out of the box, and without the Options+ software is 1000DPI. I found 8000DPI way too fast and frenetic for me to be precise with it with my use case, even though I have a 3 monitor setup with 4K monitors, but this may be helpful for others with a more expensive setup like a multi-monitors using 8K monitors which have twice as many pixels, making the average mouse pointer feel slower with the default sensor. The higher DPI sensor would allow the mouse pointer speed to move faster.
The Options+ software is also where you can set up the MX Master 3S with Flow. Flow allows you to use and control multiple computers with Options+ also installed seamlessly. Switch to another computer by simply moving your cursor to the edge of the screen. Flow also allows your to copy and paste content between those computers. However, since Flow is dependent on the Options+ software, it's only compatible with Windows and MacOS. So there is no first-party solution from Logitech for Linux, Android, or iOS.

Whereas "MX" meant the mouse employs Darkfield technology to allow tracking on virtually any surface, the "Master" means the mouse is able to pair with up to 3 devices. With a button found under the mouse, you can switch between those 3 devices. Out of the box, "1" is paired to the included Bolt receiver.
What may comes as unfortunate news to loyal Logitech users is that the Bolt receiver is not compatible with devices that use the older Unifying receiver. First introduced with Logitech's business line of products, it was designed to be more secure and perform better under busy environments that would typically cause interference with the wireless connection. Typically when this happens, users are advised to get a USB extension cable to connect the USB receiver to, so you can bring it closer to the mouse for a more reliable connection. In theory, Bolt should help prevent this. Unfortunately, I'm not in an environment with that kind of interference so I can't test this claim.

Logitech claims it has a battery life of *up to* 70 days, carefully wording it so that 70 days is their claim max point. So don't expect 70 days. The reality is, how long it lasts will vary depending on the user and how they use it. For example, with me, I'm on the computer almost all day and night, over 8 hours a day. I haven't owned the 3S long enough to test its battery life in real time to see it go from 100% to 0% but I've seen it lose 10% of battery in my 3 days of use. That would amount to about 30 days, which is the same amount of battery life I got with my MX Master 2S, which Logitech also claimed "up to 70 days". So, if you're a previous MX Master 2S or Master 3 user, expect the same amount of battery life as that. To me, this is very good battery life, as I'm an abnormal user. I spend way too much time on the computer. Perhaps the average user will get 45-50 days out of it. For someone like my mom, who is elderly and not on the computer as much, 70 days is definitely possible. This is thanks to how power efficient the mouse is. It goes into sleep mode after a long period of inactivity. I have never felt the need to power my mouse off.

The mouse charges via USB-C, and Logitech claims 3 minutes of charging will give you about a full day's worth of use.I haven't been able to test this yet because I'm still working with the initial charge that it came with out of the box, which was 45%. In 5 days of use, I've only lost a reported 10%.
That's a notable thing about the battery reporting with the MX Master 3S. You can only see the battery percentage through the Options+ app or bluetooth if you have it connected via bluetooth. And it only reports the battery percentage in intervals of 5%. So the 35% battery I'm seeing now actually means 31% to 35%.

The battery indicator on the MX Master 3S is just a single LED, albeit larger and easier to see. On the MX 2S and older, there were 3 LEDs so you could see the battery level. With one LED, you can now only see whether the battery is above 10% (green), below 10% (red), or charging (blinking). I honestly don't think this is that bad because when it turns red, that's your reminder to charge it or else it will die. And being in the red with 10% will give you 3 days of extensive usage to do it, which is plenty of time.

For loyal MX Master mouse users coming from the 2S or older, you may be in for a real unpleasant shock from all the changes they've made to the 3S. But give it time and you'll fall in love with it like I did. Bolt is the future, and Unifying will get phased out. Got to start somewhere. 3S is a great start."


string(6798) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I want to talk about the Logitech MX Master 3S Mouse in two parts:  as a mouse first and foremost and then with regard to its particular features.

Mice have been around for a long time, and just like people are always trying to build a better mousetrap, they’re also always trying to build a better mouse.  The “original” modern mouse, if you want to call it that, and I do, can be traced back to the kidney-shaped, two-button, Microsoft Serial Ball Mouse.  Everything since then has been an improvement, or an attempt to improve, on this basic design.  Most mice since then have stayed with the standard oval or kidney shape, and most of these can work for either right- or left-handed people.

Later mice have incorporated useful things like more buttons which can be separately programmed, scroll wheels, and a change from mechanical to optical tracking.  But most improvements nowadays are incremental.  The mouse clicks are a little quieter.  The scroll-wheel is more sensitive.  The tracking sensor is more precise.  There are extra buttons for customization.  Connection can be by more different ways now, too, like USB and Bluetooth, and wireless mice are now everywhere. 

But it’s still a mouse.  So let’s start with the basics.  This mouse starts off being very non-standard by being specifically designed for right-handed people.  It is highly non-symmetrical, with a large, low flange on the left side to hold your thumb. You can actually rest your thumb on this while using the mouse, not that keeping your thumb off the table is very difficult or tiring with a more conventional mouse.  But still, the little thumb support ledge feels just a bit more comfortable to hold.

This is not a small mouse.  There are mice that tout that they are for small hands or large hands, and I’ve used both.  I have large hands, and large-hand mice, while not all that much larger, really, than “regular” mice, do feel slightly more comfortable.  As it sits on the table, the mouse is angled downward to the right, so your index finger sits a little above your middle finger. This shape conforms better to the natural shape of your hand, and, again, makes this mouse just a little more comfortable to hold and use.

Overall, as a basic mouse, the MX Master 3S succeeds and then some. It is very comfortable to hold and has a nice heft and feel to it.  

Now lets get to the specifics of this mouse.

1.  The claim is that it can track on any surface.  As any seasoned optical mouse user surely knows, optical mice typically have a hard time with reflective or clear surfaces such as glass.  I encounter this problem often when traveling and am sitting at the desk in the hotel room, and the desk has a glass platen over the top of it to protect the wood finish.  Unless I remember to bring a mouse pad with me, which I never do, I end up having to get something opaque like a magazine or a folded newspaper and run the mouse over that.  This mouse eliminates this problem, a welcome feature.  To add to the benefit, the sensor is 8000 DPI and is customizable, making scrolling on any surface, glass or otherwise, more efficient.

2.  Less click noise.  Not really a big deal.  I compared the click noise on this mouse with my previous mouse and the collection of mice I have in my cabinet.  None of them make much of a click noise, and I think the last time this was an issue was about 1990.  

3.  Fast scrolling.  Yes, the main scroll wheel between the two main button is large, sculpted, and easy to use.  Sometimes I need to quickly get to page 16 of a 35 page Word document, and being able to scroll quickly to get there is greatly appreciated.

4.  Customizable buttons.  To access this, you need to download and install the Logi Options+ software.  Customizable buttons are nothing new, and having to download software to program them is also nothing newr.  In addition to the two main mouse buttons and scroll wheel, there are two buttons, one in front of the other, just above where your thumb sits, a smaller scroll wheel just above those two buttons, also designed to be operated by your thumb, and a much smaller button just behind the main scroll wheel.  Program these for your favorite software.  I have to admit that I’ve never been much of a mouse button programmer for the simple reason that I can never remember what I programmed a particular button to do.  If I did some action often enough in some piece of software, I could see programming a button to quicken this process, but I normally don’t.  But it’s there if I need it.

5.  Connectivity is by USB or Bluetooth.  In both situations, the mouse can be programmed to work with up to three different devices.  Being able to use the same mouse at home on my desktop and then away from home on my laptop can be particularly useful if I have programmed one or more buttons to work with specific software.  I just have to remember to take the mouse with me when I travel!  The mouse can be also be connected to different operating environments, such as Window OS on this computer MacOS on that computer, Linux on another computer, and so forth.  This can be very handy for some people.

One thing that threw me for a loop briefly when I first took the mouse out of the box was powering it. I assume I would have to insert one or maybe two AA batteries, which is common for wireless mice.  But I quickly found that there was no battery compartment, and a quick check of the box revealed that the battery is permanent and is rechargable through a USB-C port on the front edge of the mouse.  There is no mention of this in the paper documentation, only on the exterior of the box.  It says that a one-minute charge yields three hours of use while a full-charge can last 70 days.  I have not tested the latter claim, and I decided to simply charge the mouse for an hour before using it the first time.  I’ve been using it since then for about four days, and I’ve had no power issues.  I do switch the mouse off when not using it to conserve battery life.  A USB-2 to USB-C cable is included, so the mouse can be charged from most any USB-2 wall adapter, not to mention a computer with a USB-2 port.  I used my cell-phone’s USB-C wall charger and cable to charge this mouse.  While not intended to be accessed regularly, instructions are provided on removing the lithium battery should it ever need to be replaced.


This mouse has become my main mouse. I would like it if it had nothing more than the unusual, hand-shaped design with thumb rest.  I have used unusually-shaped mice before, but none have been comfortable enough to become my main mouse.  But this one is different.  Highly recommended if for no other reason than that.  The rest is gravy."


string(1527) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been using this new MX Master for the past couple days of work, syncing this both to my work computer and personal computer. I have the original MX Master from 2017 and its been nice noticing the upgrades and changes that have come along in the last 5 years. The form factor feels better in my hand and I like the visual aesthetic with some harder edges that the original. There were two major features that Logitech highlighted with the release of the 3S: Softer click buttons and a finer DPI laser that allows you to use the mouse on any surface. I'm not sure if I were buying this in a vacuum I would notice how soft the buttons are, but when comparing to the original Master the sound of clicking is night/day different and allows my to click around through documents while on calls without my mic picking it up. While I confess that I did not try the mouse on glass, I was really impressed with how smooth this mouse moves on cork, leather and wood. I feel confident that it would be smooth on any conference room table or office setup and allows you to move exactly where you want. 

In short this mouse will work with any device - I've connected it to my work ChromeOS and MacOS machines and my personal Windows 11 machine, provides high quality movement on any surface, is extremely (ALL DAY) comfortable in your hand, and has made notable improvements on what was already a great platform. I highly recommend this as the best mouse you can buy for a home office"


string(263) "I purchased this mouse to replace a cheap Microsoft mouse provided by my employer.  I could not be more happy.  I was concerned how long the charge would last but I have had it for 10 days and it is still at 90%.  

Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase."


string(180) "Logitech - MX Master 3S is a upgrade from my MX Master 3.  I prefer this version over the older one due to its quietness on clicking.  I enjoy clicking the mouse without the noise."


string(182) "The new silent feature in the 3S is fantastic! The same great feel as the original MX Master is great, and the multi-device connection makes going between work and personal seamless."


string(78) "Same as the old MX Master 3 - the best in my opinion but with less click noise"


string(119) "I work from home and on the computer all day. This mouse is one of the best investments I’ve made. Worth every penny."


string(243) "This is the best mouse I've ever used. The ability to program all of the buttons, and there are several of them, makes this a super versatile product. Additionally, the fast-scroll wheel and the ergonomics make this a perfect 5 out of 5 stars."


string(331) "Imagine cutting a stick of butter with a hot knife? Oh well, the glide on this thing is godly! I've been around a lot of mice in my day. I thought the magic mouse was the best thing since sliced bread. I was wrong MX S3 really is in a class of its own it also has the 8k DPI if you're a gamer then this mouse is also useful to you!"


string(464) "Love the mouse, but it is lacking for a productivity mouse.

Infinite scroll is now magnetic, which is still great but less satisfying. There are very few buttons on this mouse, and if you are used to gaming mice, it is quite puzzling why there are so few for a mouse that doesn't really need to shave weight.

For what it is, I like it, but Logitech made the hump of the mouse too tall, and while you can get used to it, it's not ideal for me.

Good, not perfect."


string(116) "A must have for your work flow. The customization that automatically adjusts depending on the app your in is a must."


string(303) "This is the perfect mouse.  The 3S clicking is super quiet. I don't hear my clicks at all with the AC or ceiling fan running in my house.  Way better than the super loud clicks of the MX Master 3.  The MX Master 3 should've originally came with these same quiet clicks when it was released back in 2019."


string(100) "Bought this mouse to use for work and it has been great. So much better than using a standard mouse."


string(176) "Excellent mouse! I previously had the MX Master 2 and 3. Saw this was out and even though the changes are minor I had to get it. Highly recommended. I love how quiet it is now."


string(607) "Don't bother. But the non-S model on sale instead.
Incredible build quality! But the bolt connection is incompatible with all unifying receiver products (which are far more numerous). And the easy-switch function is still tied to the button on the bottom of the mouse. (And you still can't reassign the function in their software either. I tried) The mouse click IS mostly silent, just as advertised. And there's a better sensor now. But literally nothing else has changed that matters. Get the non-S model instead. It has everything that's great about this mouse. But more compatible and sometimes on sale."


string(276) "my one gripe is that it doesn't work on OSX Mojave as Options+ is 10.15+ only. BUT I absolutely love this mouse. The Master 3 click were so loud, it felt obnoxious clicking it while on Zoom calls. The 3S fixed this and it's barely a whisper now. Absolutely well done Logitech!"


string(52) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 29"


string(662) "The MX Master 3 is one of the best mouses for productivity and while the 3S is mostly similar, the improvements are much welcomed and I've been able to benefit from them so far. Here's what I like about it

- Black over Graphite. I don't know why but the black just looks more premium over the previous graphite version.
- Reduced clicking noise. The difference is VERY noticeable and I'm sure my co-workers appreciate my less  obnoxious clicking sounds.
- Improved DPI sensor. I've tested it on my glass table and it works well. Although I don't work on it often, it's nice to have the ability to use my mouse now and not have to use my laptop's awful trackpad."


string(169) "I came from the MX Master 2S and this mouse is not only more comfortable, but also the click is SO quiet. 8K DPI isn't for me but for those that need it, it seems great."


string(1019) "Coming from the Logitech MX Master mouse (which is still working and being used for my PC), the MS Master 3S was a nice addition, which is being used for my Mac. The two main differences compared to the Master 3 are the quiet clicks and the 8,000 DPI over the previous 4,000 DPI. It works well, and the horizontal scroll wheel is such a nice thing to have, especially in applications horizontal movement.

Two things that I'm not too fond of with the newer design is 
1.) The horizontal scroll wheel is recessed in slightly, making ever so slightly annoying to use. On the original MX, it was much more easier to access and use. 

2.) The thumb controls buttons are not as easy to use either (in my opinion). You have to extend your thumb to really reach the forward button. 

Other than that, it's worked well, with the quiet clicks being my most favorite feature of the mouse. There are other features as well that make it of more versatile use, and will continue to use the MX series if they keep up the good record."


string(314) "I upgraded from the MX Master 3 and to be honest I was not sure if this S version was not going to be worthwhile upgrade.  But after using this mouse for about a week, I must say I am very happy with this mouse.  The quite click was worth the upgrade.  The 3S is just as good as the MX Master 3.   Glad I upgraded."


string(328) "This a wonderful mouse.  It feels great and scrolls well.  Setup was easy using LogiOption+ , but.  I use Microsoft Office Pro 2019 but unfortunately the supplied applications for excel, PowerPoint, and Word, won’t install.  I’m waiting for Logitech technical support for a possible solution.  Regardless is excellent mouse."


string(206) "I've used various versions of the MX Master and this continues the streak. The only small nitpick I have is I wish it was a little heavier or there was an option to add weights to it like their gaming mice."


string(61) "The silent click is a welcome improvement over the last model"


string(91) "Very easy to use, love the scrolling feature and that it can change between laptops easily."


string(1336) "Great mouse, though not light-years beyond the MX3 model.  Ultra-high DPI is nice.

However, there is one huge flaw with this mouse - Logitech changed the wireless receiver standard from the Unifying spec to Logi Bolt.

The Bolt is supposed to be more secure and use Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is nice, but they did not make it backwards compatible with devices that connect via the Unifying receiver!  

Meaning, if you still use older Logitech hardware, you need to have two receivers connected to your laptop (where open USB ports may already be scarce).  In addition, I wanted to switch my mouse between my work and personal computers.  But now that this mouse only works with the Bolt, I would have to buy another Bolt receiver so I can interchange between the two machines.    *eye-roll*

Sadly, I didn't know that Logitech was releasing this new standard, and it isn't well advertised on the packaging that it uses the Bolt, so it's easy to get surprised.  I contacted Logitech Tech Support and there seems to no plan to make Bolt compatible with devices that connected via Unifying.

So, sadly I have to return this because the ability to switch the mouse between my machines on the fly was my main objective, and I refuse to buy another receiver because Logitech didn't think about making Bolt backwards compatible."


string(345) "I didn’t think this mouse could get any better, but here I am reviewing the newest version. The click sound is near nonexistent, the gliding on the desk is as smooth as ever, and the color looks extra rich and classy. There’s a new app to connect it to your PC, so I’d be weary of that. But otherwise once it’s working; it’s wonderful."


string(174) "As a Graphic Designer.. I'm loving the productivity I'm getting out of this mouse. I've been using an Apple Magic Mouse for the past decade and this was just a great upgrade!"


string(233) "Huge upgrade from my wired mouse. Zero wire drag. The clicks are the quietest I ever used. Super comfortable.
With Logi app, setup your buttons and it saves in mouse.
I used half a dozen of gaming mouse before, this blow it all away."


string(235) "It's weird to say I am excited about something like a mouse, but I am.

I had the MX3 mouse and it was great but the MX3 S is even better. It is smoooooooth, and the clicking is quiet and just feels like.

Well worth the $99 price tag."


string(140) "Superb mouse as expected. The buttons are very tactile while being very quiet. Expensive but worth the money if you do a lot of office work."


string(1458) "my biggest qualms with the original MX Master 3 was the shrill, loud clicks and the fact that it came in a really ugly dark gray color alongside the horrendous native scrolling. i actually forced myself to use the magic mouse 2 for a while and through immeasurable pain because despite its awful shape, the magic mouse had really satisfying clicks and stupendously fluid scrolling.

but after only a few hours of use all i can say is i absolutely love this newer version of master 3. firstly, it fixes the loud annoying clicks in exchange for a very subtle, bass heavy thocky sound instead that i just love. seriously, i cannot stress enough how much a silent, more satisfying tacticle click makes a difference in workflow. my m1 macbook pro is already dead silent, and in conjunction with this mouse i'm basically working in absolute quiet.

as far as scrolling goes, logitech hasnt done much to resolve that issue but using a program called MOS in conjunction with Options+ SmoothScrolling option I've found a way to mimic the natural fluid scrolling of the magic devices, so i'm happy in that regard as well. if logitech could look into making smoothscroll better this mouse would be peak.

and finally, a truly black color. really the only way they could make this mouse better is if they provided a USBC dongle instead, but as is i'm really happy to be able to throw my magic mouse away and my hand is eternally grateful for the lack of pain forthcoming"


string(441) "I upgraded from a Master 2s from Logitech. That mouse was always so great! Plenty of features, plus lots of customizability. Now, the 3s takes everything that was great about the 2s and makes it even greater. The silent clicking in the buttons is a great touch, and it also feels lighter in the hand compared to my predecessor. Overall, if you have the money for it, do it. It’s a great tool to have both in productivity and creative apps."


string(295) "I love the mouse and this iteration will take some getting used to with the move of the side buttons but feels great.

Thing to note:  The version I just purchased is NOT RF compatible...so read carefully before purchasing.  I have a number of devices on Unify and is much more reliable than BT."

There were two issues 1) quality control seems to be a bit of a problem. I ordered two of them and one was noticeably smoother than the other and just performed better. I'd recommend that if you receive it and you like it but it feels like its just short of perfect then exchange it for another. You just might get one that works perfectly. 

2) AVOID THE WHITE MODEL AT ALL COSTS. It changes to yellow after a few uses. Others have made the same comments. It seems to be an ongoing issue which reflects badly on this company that they would continue to distribute it. In any case, the white looks amazing but I am telling you... you need to avoid it anyway. It's really too bad because it was very sharp looking."

My only complaints are there's not a spot to store the USB receiver in the mouse (not a huge deal since it can connect to 3 Bluetooth devices) and the mouse has no onboard memory. The lack of onboard memory is the bigger issue, as I can't install the Options+ app on my work PC, meaning I am unable to take full advantage of the mouse on the PC where the customizability would be most useful. But even without onboard memory this is my favorite mouse I've used and I decided to keep it over the likes of the Logitech G604, Razer Basilisk, and JLab Epic Mouse."

Unfortunately, with the 3 and 3S Logitech changed the shape of the mouse.  The curve that supports your palm is no longer a smooth arc, but instead is more sharply curved where the new (useless) power LED is.  That has caused me some significant hand stiffness and has rendered the mouse useless to me.

It still has the smooth scroll wheel and other features, sure, but they're of no use if I can't use the mouse comfortably.  Fortunately there seem to be a lot of Master 2S mice floating around for sale."

The device comes with a Dongle for quick connection, but also has Bluetooth access. Up to 3 devices can be stored for quick switching.

  string(1575) "TL;DR: Cursor will jump on Apple devices using the BOLT Nano Adapter 

Review:
Logitech make some of the best accessories on the market.  I have been a user of their MX series line since it came out years ago. As someone that uses their devices in a more professional environment, my use case will see that these devices are used more often than others. 

When Logitech announced that they will be moving to the new BOLT nano adapter for MX mouse series, I wanted to upgrade our existing MX Master 3 mouse to this new one.

That was a major mistake as the BOLT nano adapter is not 100% compatible with Apple's ridiculous requirements for external devices. If you plan to use this with an Apple device, common issues will be jumpy cursors, inconsistence scrolling and device time-outs. 

This has been well documented and acknowledged by Logitech and their Reddit support page. 

The device itself has a nice feel in the hand and as a Mac user, it offers enough creature comforts that using any other mouse sucks.

With that said, I have also tried using the mouse as a standard BT directly connected to the Apple Mac Studio, it should work for a period of time but will time out due to new Apple security policies. 

Another limitation to Apple is that they don't allow non-Apple products to control the computer before logging in.  This is one of the reason you need to use the NANO adapter as it functions as a connection keyboard/mouse connection. 

Would I recommend this mouse, Yes.  But not for Apple users.  This mouse will work great with Windows and Linux computers."

  string(1755) "Buyers take note.  This is a fantastic mouse, however, it now uses a different adapter (Bolt) than the MX Keys series (Unifying) over the previous 3 version, which is not cross compatible.  This means it is no longer unifying and requires a different wireless adapter than the MX Keys.

This is a change from the previous 3 model.  I specifically bought this along with the MX Keys to switch between three PC and Mac computers (Unifying), as I was aware of the good reputation for pairing the MX Keys and MX Master 3 together, and I splurged to finally replace three keyboards and mice.  Now, I'm stuck with either using Bluetooth only or returning it.

The 3 model was no longer available, and this was marketed as the new upgrade and even displayed together at Best Buy.   However, I discovered this change only after buying it.  You have to read the fine print to learn this.  I usually research these things to death before buying gear, but I trusted Logitech on this one.  Lesson learned.

Logitech, take note, if you're going to make a change this impactful it warrants more a more dissimilar model name.  I've since noticed a lot of other angry customers on forums mentioning they fell into this same trap, so I just wanted to share it here to help inform others.

Make no mistake, the 3S is a much better mouse spec-wise than the 3 series if this is not a factor for you.  I still love this mouse and am debating whether to keep it and use with Bluetooth.  You can get around this issue by using it only with Bluetooth, but there are technical reasons I prefer a receiver instead.
 
If it weren't for this issue I would have given it 5 stars, but  I'm docking two so people take notice.  If you know this going in and don't care, it's a great buy."

  string(1344) "The ergonomic design is comfortable to use for long periods of time and the ultrafast scrolling feature has made navigating through documents and websites a breeze. The customization options are also a great bonus, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs. The USB-C, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity options make it easy to use with a variety of devices.
First of all, the ergonomic design is top-notch. The shape of the mouse fits comfortably in my hand and the thumb rest and gesture button allow me to use the mouse without straining my hand or wrist. This is especially important for me as I tend to use a mouse for long periods of time and have experienced discomfort with other models in the past. The Logitech MX Master 3S has completely eliminated that issue for me.
The ultrafast scrolling feature is also a game-changer. I frequently have to scroll through long documents and websites, and the smooth and precise scrolling on the MX Master 3S makes that task much easier and more efficient. It's a small detail, but it has made a big difference in my daily workflow.
Overall, the Logitech MX Master 3S is a fantastic mouse that has greatly improved my productivity and comfort while using a computer. It's a high-quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone in need of a reliable and comfortable wireless mouse."

Every button being remappable for the entire device and on a per app basis is very nice to allow for ease of navigation and usability of certain apps. My only complaints are in the shape and weight of the mouse alongside the polling rate. I notice that the mouse only polls at 125hz which sometimes feels jittery due to dropped packages. The weight is a bit heavier than I'd like, and the shape misses some curves that could make the mouse fatiguing to use for a long duration for certain grip types. However these issues only apply tp those that use a lower DPI, and people that use a more typical high DPI will find no issues with this."

The form and functionality of the mouse are exceptional. It is ergonomically sculpted for use with a large, right hand. The scroll wheel is amazing and effortlessly zips through large amounts of vertically oriented information. Buttons are well placed (i.e., out of the way but easily enabled).

My only complaint is that the wireless dongle is USB A. My new laptop has only USB C ports and the dongle requires a C to A USB adapter. I wound up using Bluetooth for a dongle-free connection. This required that I keep Bluetooth active when in sleep mode. Otherwise, the mouse had to be reacquired every time the laptop woke up.

@Logitech, please design a USB C wireless dongle and include a USB C charging cable for this mouse."

This mouse was on the same display cap as the rest of the Logi MX devices, but be aware, it uses a different dongle than the rest. The MX Keys that I have use the Logi Unifying Receiver dongle, and this MX Master 3S mouse uses the Logi Bolt dongle. They are NOT compatible, and thus you will have to use both dongles in your PC/Mac. 
The alternative is to pair both devices with Bluetooth which I will do and revise my review.
On to the rest...
The movement and scroll are really smooth. Significantly better that my old M705, which at the time, was the best Logi made. All of the buttons and wheel functions are programmable when you install the Logi Options+ App. Logi has also updated the charging port to USB C, which is the same as my MX Keys port.
It takes a little getting used to, but the side to side scroll is controlled by the wheel on the side, above your thumb and it is so smooth.
All in all, this mouse is a significant upgrade to my M705.
I totally recommend it."

The click is a lot quieter than the mx master 3, and i didnt appreciate that until i owned this one, but it shouldnt be a big impact on deciding between the 3 and 3s. The one quark ive noticed is when you scroll veritcal and then horizontal immediately, you need to pause a second, or it will continie to scroll in  the direction you first started. The reciever is also updated now and it doesnt connect to the orange logo unifying receivers."

Being able to re-assign the middle "freescroll" button to something else shows that the engineers designing it actually use this thing. I had two of the MX Master 1 but Im going on 3 years with this one and it still feels premium. I figured with my history that the Scroll would get messed up and start being janky, Thankfully I was wrong. One of the few times a premium item from Logitech is worth the recommendation. Higher DPI would be nice but doesn't really affect my usage of it. 

It has really just disappeared into my desk and usage, and only calls attention to itself when I have to use other "lesser" mice, Which is exactly what you want from any peripheral."

The shape is good.  I have big hands and the body is allows for various hand positions.  It would be good for a small handed person, too.  Maybe even better.  

The scroll wheel is unlike anything I've used before.  There is a "brake" on it, and when engaged, it has those small clicks like a normal mouse scroll wheel.  You'd want to use that for scrolling down a web page, for example.  Whenever you want a lot of control.  But the best part is if you spin that scroll wheel hard, or disengage the brake, it will just spin...for a very long time.  You could scroll down 1000 pages with one flick of your finger.  No joke.  The scroll wheel must have a little weight to it because it will spin forever.  If you find yourself scrolling large distances in large documents or code, you will love this mouse.

Battery life is outstanding.  There's no RGB but that's okay.

Seriously, Logitech. This is where you decided to cut cost on a $100 mouse? a 2 feet long USB-C charging cable. 
Your company used to have #1 customer support and you decided to cheap out on a premium product.

It is still the same fantastic productivity mouse. Comfortable. Numerous buttons in all the right places. Scroll wheel speed control. Perhaps most importantly, the excellent Logi software that gives you complete control over the mouse, globally, and in specific programs.

The original MX mouse also needed to be recharged every few days for me, which was often quite annoying. I have owned this new 3S mouse for a couple of weeks now and the original charge is still at 65% despite heavy use every day. So it doesn't appear that I will need to recharge this mouse very often at all. Another thing I really like about this new version is the nearly silent clicks. You literally can barely hear it when you click on the buttons, and it just seems flawlessly smooth in operation. Another nice upgrade is the increased 8K DPI resolution tracking. If you have a large 4K display connected, you can literally just zip the cursor from one corner of the screen to another super fast with this enabled.

  string(1976) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] An optical mouse is nothing new for any of us in 2022. Even wireless mice are probably considered old school by now. So, why is this the better option than what you already have?

Ultimately, this does what every other mouse does, but just a little bit better. It comes with a few extra buttons (and wheel) which are very easy to customize with the downloadable software. In particular, I really appreciate the sun wheel that sits directly below your left some along with the included back/forward buttons. You can customize any of these buttons to whatever keystroke you’d prefer, but I find the default settings to be perfect for me. Assuming you are right handed, this may be the most comfortable mouse I’ve ever used.

Tracking is fast and very precise, and while it is not marketed as a gaming mouse, it seems more than adequate for that application, as well. Compared to my wired “gaming mouse“, I really can’t discern a difference (although I am admittedly not a hard-core, third person shooter, kind of guy)…. 

Wireless performance is seamless, as would be expected. One of the nice features of this particular mouse is that it can be connected either via Bluetooth or using the wireless dongle connected to a open the USB port. I can’t discern any particular latency with either option. It does have a onboard memory that will remember multiple devices, so it is easy to switch use from your desktop to a laptop, for example.

Wow this does have some nice bells and whistle‘s, ultimately what matters is whether or not it functions as you would expect.  As already stated, for me this mouse is a solid improvement over my prior pointing device, and just seems a bit more polished in every way. For something that we use for probably 75% (conservative estimate) of our computer interaction - which for many of us can be several hours a day - this is more than a worthwhile investment. Two thumbs up!"

Additionally, the Logitech software didn't recognize the mouse, so I couldn't customize any settings (despite using the included Logitech dongle and such). I'm sure I could have gotten it working with updates or reinstalling drivers, or something, but it's kind of unfortunate it didn't just work out of the box.

  string(2189) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been using this mouse at work and home for several days, and I really want to love it. 

To start with, there's a lot of good here. The tracking sensor is very accurate and works on every surface I've tried, from a glass tabletop to a bedsheet that always gives other mice trouble when using my laptop in bed. It's got a variety of DPI settings from 200 to 8k that make working on high resolution displays or small surfaces a breeze. I'm still figuring out all of the stuff a horizontal scoll wheel is useful for. I was surprised when I found it allows me to quickly zoom in and out or adjust the size of brush in photoshop, for example. The buttons and scroll wheels are near silent, which is interesting, but not particularly useful to me, so I can take it or leave it. As quiet as they are, they still have enough tactile feedback that it doesn't feel strange. 

In general, this mouse feels different to other mice I have, and I'm not entirely sure why. I feel like it sits higher overall, but fits to my hand in much the same way. It's not really any more or less comfortable, just different.

Battery life so far is great. I've been using it for five days and haven't had to recharge it yet. The wireless mouse I normally use needs to be plugged in about every two or three days to charge with moderate use. 

Unfortunately, it's got a bit of a problem with the vertical scroll wheel. It's just not accurate. Sometimes I'll wheel down a "notch" and nothing happens, or I'll be scrolling down and it'll just stop for a moment before it starts registering again. It's noticeable when it happens, and it happens often enough to be annoying. Even the cheapest of basic mice don't tend to have this problem, so I really don't expect it to happen with a premium product like this. I tried the Logi Options+ software to see if there was a firmware update available, but it said the mouse was up to date. Hopefully a future update can fix it.

All things considered, it's a great mouse in a lot of ways, and Logitech products are generally high quality, so I'll recommend it under the assumption that that mine just has a rare defect."

The software allows you to customize the buttons on the mouse to have quick-click functionality for whatever environment you're using it in. I like scrolling through tabs with the thumbwheel, personally.

The design of the mouse feels more ergonomically correct than most mice I've used over the last 28 years, and it has a fantastic weight, giving it a solidity that they have often been lacking. The texture of the surface is pleasant, and it really looks and feels like they put a lot of thought into the aesthetics.

The advantages are the silent click and higher Dpi sensor. The sensor is beneficial if you want to move across the screen with minimal wrist movement or if you have multiple monitors. At 8k dpi you'll be able to move across a 27" screen with almost no noticeable wrist movement.

One thing i have noticed is that the scroll wheel has not been super silent, especially during ratcheting mode. Ergonomically perfect, very comfortable to use and play with. 

The mouse works on pretty much all kinds of surfaces, can easily connect to 3 devices, and can connect by using bluetooth or a USB dongle. The one thing I haven’t figured out yet is, when installing the custom profiles so that the mouse switches behavior based on the application you are using.

  string(2149) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you've worked with any of the previous versions of this mouse, you know that they fit your hand like a glove--assuming you're right-handed at least. The 3S is no difference. It fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. The two main buttons and scroll wheel feel great. The horizontal scroll wheel and button on the left where your thumb rests are all within reach for the one finger. 

The largest upgrade from the previous version of this mouse has to be, hands down, the clicking noise - or lack thereof! The difference is night and day! This new mouse is so incredibly quiet when clicking the right and left buttons. It's advertised at 90% quieter, and I believe it! If you're in a quiet room, especially with a partner studying or something, the reduced clicking noise alone will save you from ugly looks from them.

The tracking sensor on the 3S is rated at 8,000 DPI, which is double that of the pervious version. While I cannot say that I've noticed any difference, twice the rated performance is cool to know. Not only does it provide even better, more precise tracking of movement, but it also helps performance over a wide variety of surfaces. I have a mixed material desk (wood and glass). While the mouse is always on a mouse pad, I have tried it on the clear glass surface and it worked just fine.

Connect this mouse up to three devices via Bluetooth or the included USB dongle. The mouse does have a USB-C port for charging, so you can use your own cable or the included USB-A to -C cable.

The software allows you to customize the various buttons on the mouse and enhance its capabilities on both Mac and Windows. The software also allows you to seamlessly switch between screens with Logitech Flow (a software feature). I've used it on my desktop and laptop and works okay, I guess. It's just not how I work, but it's there if you really want to take advantage of it.

If you already own the MX 3, I wouldn't say the upgrade is worth it. If you're coming from a 2S or earlier version, or are looking for an incredible mouse, then I would absolutely recommend the MX Master 3S."

  string(5310) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech’s MX Master 3s mouse represents the pinnacle of the MX series mice.  It offers refinement in materials, buttons, noise, connectivity, and ergonomics that set it apart from its predecessors.  As a long time fan of the MX series this mouse tops the Master/Performance series by a good margin.

First of all, I’ll lead with the fact that Logitech has gone a long way to making their packaging more environmentally friendly.  Practically all the packaging was made of cardboard that’s easily recyclable instead of the “I’m going to cut you” plastic of yesteryear.  I appreciate this movement, and it means I can recycle or keep the box.  The mouse itself feels even more durable and the materials in use feel like this mouse will last a good long while.  While it does not include a user serviceable battery, I can attest that my 10 year old Performance MX can hold enough charge to be useful to this day, so I’m not concerned about this mouse becoming e-waste.

Now, a few things to know about this mouse: It’s a continuation of the original MX Performance mouse, but really it’s a reimagined MX Master 3.  The Master 3s adds a new 8K sensor, super quiet buttons and an even quieter scroll wheel without messing with the existing ergonomics and connectivity already associated with the MX Master 3.  If you have a Master 3, you may not want to upgrade, but if you’re an OG or Master 2 mouse user, this is a worthy upgrade for sure.  Included in the box is a Bolt receiver which can be used with the first channel, and the other two channels can use Bluetooth (or another receiver).  Finally a USB-C to USB-A cable is included for charging.

Speaking of charging, Logitech claims 3 hours of use from a single minute of charging.  70 days is possible from a full charge.  While I can’t verify those claims, almost a week of use hasn’t dented the battery significantly.  USB-C charging means this guy is pretty universally chargeable.  One thing I noticed is that it didn’t seem to be able to operate as a wired mouse when plugged in (and no receivers or connections).

If you’re new to the MX Series, what really sets these mice apart is the scroll wheel.  Designed to be able to flick through an Excel spreadsheet at lightning speed (Logitech claims 1000 lines per second), the free spinning scroll wheel was an experiment that really did catch on with those that adopted the performance MX.  Originally a click in on the scroll wheel would change between free scrolling and clicky, but the later Master mice swapped to an automatic trigger (although the button right behind the wheel swaps modes).  If you scroll with enough force, the clicky scrolling gives way to free scrolling.  The MagSpeed scroll wheel is unique and functional.  This, combined with the larger shape, and plethora of buttons is what made the MX Performance/Master mice popular amongst business/software professionals.

With the MX Master a horizontal scroll wheel was added, and this eventually turned into a more prominent feature.  While some pros do use the horizontal scroll wheel to move about in their enormous excel spreadsheets, I love Logitech’s Options+ software.  Not only can I set the primary feature to be volume control, in which the horizontal scroll wheel's heavy weighted feel is quite natural at, but the software also installs profiles: for instance in chrome, I can simply swap tabs using the horizontal scroll wheel, or use it for zoom in a powerpoint presentation.

Another big feature that’s unique to the MX series is the darkfield sensor.  While Logitech has dropped the marketing wording around it, it’s still quiet the achievement in laser technology.  The ability to track on glass is still not the most universal feature, and this mouse basically will track on any surface pretty accurately.  

The big differentiator for the 3s is the quiet click buttons.  It delivers its promise.  While being nearly inaudible, the buttons still maintain a satisfying click feel. Logitech made sure every button had this feel, which is a nice touch.  The thumb base button also feels quite soft.  I was impressed that button included gestures for multi-tasking that map very naturally into Windows 10/11 and Mac OS.

Speaking of, the Logitech MX Master 3s fits right in a Mac environment.  Logitech Options+ software works well on both Mac and Windows and enables things like Flow, which can transfer text, images, and even files between computers.  It even allows swapping between computers by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen.  Logitech has really done an amazing job nailing the software, as Flow is super slick.

Overall the MX Master 3s is a refinement upon several refinements.  I’ve long been a fan of these mice, and despite what some may say, I’ve successfully played twitch shooters on these mice for years to great effect.  The ability to trace anywhere is one of my favorite features.  I’ve been a long time user of the smaller Anywhere MX series, but this full size MX feels more natural than any of the other full size MX mice I’ve used in the past (Performance MX, Master MX).  For productivity, it’s hard to imagine a better mouse.  Logitech continues to deliver the best mice in the industry."

  string(3772) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The MX Master 3S is my new favorite mouse for work. It’s extremely comfortable to use, has solid performance over Bluetooth or Logi Bolt, the side scroll wheel has a lot of convenient uses, and the battery lasts long enough that I never have to worry about charging. For productivity focused work it feels like the peak.

Getting into the box, you get the mouse, a charging cable, and a Logi Bolt receiver. It should be noted the Logi Bolt receiver is somewhat new and not compatible with older Logitech devices that used the Unifying receiver. Something to keep in mind if you are already using other Logitech devices with an existing receiver. I set the mouse up first using the Logi Bolt receiver and the mouse appears to be pre-paired to it out of the box, so there was nothing for me to do but plug it into an existing USB-A port. Running the setup through the Logi Options+ software I was able to make assignments on each button and set up application-specific profiles. It is unfortunate that the Logi Options+ software isn’t compatible with all of Logitech’s mice and keyboards; currently I still need to use the older Logitech Options for my K680 keyboard.

I’ve been using the MX Master 3S for a couple of weeks now and have used it as my primary work mouse for about a week. I’ve used it interchangeably over Bluetooth and with the Logi Bolt receiver in a relatively crowded office environment and the performance has been flawless in both cases. I cannot really point to a difference in using the mouse with the Bolt receiver or over Bluetooth. I think I might notice a little bit less latency over Bolt, but the difference is almost imperceptible. The first thing I noticed was how comfortable it was. It feels like it’s perfectly sculpted for my hand and the soft-touch plastic helps a lot as well. The side scroll wheel feels well positioned and I don’t have to strain my hand to get to it. The main scroll wheel feels similar to the MX Anywhere 3 and transitions seamlessly from stepping scrolling to free-wheeling and it felt really easy to dial in exactly the speed I wanted for the email or document I was working on. The primary left and right click buttons are very quiet, but there’s a tactileness to them that never makes me question whether or not I’ve clicked. With the software installed, the mouse will automatically switch profiles for applications you have loaded, which I think might work well for some people, but for me it was a little jarring to have the side scroll wheel flipping between tabs on Chrome only to then be adjusting volume or changing cells somewhere else. Thankfully, this is easy to turn off. There is also a button on the thumb rest that opens up some gesture controls. I didn’t get much use out of the gesture controls myself, but they work well enough. The cursor tracks smoothly across a variety of surfaces, though I can’t say I noticed too much of a difference turning the 8K sensor mode on. The standard mode (which is what the previous MX Master 3 has) is probably what most would use I’d imagine.

The battery life has been excellent for me. I’ve used it for several full days and not seen the percentage drop at all. It’s quoted at 70 days by Logitech and I’m inclined to believe that. It’s certainly long enough that charging is never really on my mind.

Before the MX Master 3S I was using the MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. I like that mouse a lot and ergonomics are important to me, but I’m considering switching to the MX Master 3S full time now just for the sheer amount of productivity features it gets me.It’s no gaming mouse and if you’re a lefty you’re out of luck, but for work I haven’t used anything better."

First thing I did after taking the Logitech MX Master 3S out of the box was charge it with the included USB C cord, and Logitech claims the battery will last up to 70 days which is more than enough lasting power for me, if I get a month or so I’ll be happy. Time will tell.

The Logitech MX Master 3S comes with an included Logi Bolt Bluetooth receiver but I didn’t need to use it for any of my devices. 

I paired my Logitech MX Master 3S with my MacBook, a Windows Gaming Laptop and an iPad Pro and once paired switching and working with different devices back and forth was seamless.

The Logitech MX Master 3S is fully customizable if using the Logi Options+ software which is available for PC and Mac.

  string(2002) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve owned many logi mice over the years, and they tend to be my go to brand for work and school. I wanted this mouse for my work from home setup, in lieu of the wired one provided to me. As always out of the box it was an easy setup, you really can just plug in and go for basic features. Had no problems with my work laptop connecting once I put the provided USB into it. First thing I noticed was how incredibly quiet it was while right, or left clicking. The Quiet Click feature is literally silent, and I can say I’ve never experienced such a genuinely quiet mouse click. The next thing I noticed was the scroll wheel, which is advertised as Magspeed, and once again something I’ve never seen before. The way it smoothly, and quickly can spin in a full rotation off of one stroke of the finger is super impressive. There are plenty of customizable options literally at your fingertips which I feel a lot of people will appreciate. The design is sleek, and visually appealing. 

The cons for me was although Logitech advertises a track glass, 8K dpi sensor that will work on any surface, that wasn’t the case for me. I have a gaming mousepad that spans my entire desk, and it literally felt like a workout moving the mouse around, despite the previous one by logi I used had no issues. I don’t want to have to rearrange my setup, just to accommodate this mouse. Also, it wasn’t as comfortable in my hand, and after only 10 minutes of use I felt some discomfort. I’m not sure if it was from having to exert so much energy to move the mouse around, or the design, but I feel both. The thumb pad is a nice ergonomic feature, but it just was not as comfortable to me in hand and I cannot use this everyday, for 8 hours at work which was disappointing. Maybe this would be better for other people, with different ergonomic needs than I. Overall, I would recommend this to the right person, and right setup, but may not work for everyone."

  string(1171) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech has long been known for quality PC mice and keyboards and the MX Master 3S does not disappoint. It balances style and comfort, looking great on the desk while comfortable in your hand. 

The Logitech MX Master 3S connects to the PC using either Bluetooth or a small USB device called the Logitech Bolt receiver. Most laptops will have Bluetooth and even many desktops and so that’s likely your preferred method of connecting.

If using a PC that doesn’t support Bluetooth you can use the supplied Logitech Bolt USB receiver. Note that this is the traditional style USB-A and not the more recent USB-C. Arguably this is understandable as more devices still use the older style USB ports so it increases compatibility, especially with devices that do not support Bluetooth.

Charging the mouse is done with the supplied USB-A to USB-C cable and it charges quickly. One nice feature is that the port on the mouse is on the front and so it can be used while the device is charging. 

Overall, if you’re looking for a great mouse for home, work or school, this is an excellent option that will not disappoint."

I don't do precision mouse work so much of the improvement is lost on me. Still, much like the Master 3 it's a great mouse. You'll notice a bigger difference between the 2S and 3S, not least going from microUSB charging to USB-C. Being able to easily switch between multiple computers is useful for me and works very well. If you're looking to replace the cheap wired mouse that came with your computer the 3S is a no brainer."

  string(1929) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After 3 years of heavy usage, I was able to upgrade from the Master 3 as my main mouse (which is now my travel mouse) to the Master 3s. Though the look of the mouse is practically identical to its predecessor, the mechanical upgrade does make a big difference. 

One of the biggest pain points from the Master 3 was how loud the clicking noise was. As a designer, I do click a lot and it was the most annoying thing to other people. When you're clicking away in an isolated room, it probably doesn't matter as much but if you're next to someone using the mouse as a designer - its pretty distracting. I didn't realize until a colleague commented on it. But with the Master 3s, I was blown away how quiet the clicking was. 

There's also more sensor sensitivity options for those with higher resolution screens, I usually set mine at 1800 DPI,you can set it up to 8k max.

Same as its predecessor, you can easily switch between different devices and adjust the settings of the horizontal/vertical scrolls, and other buttons depending on the program you're using through the Logi options app. Which as a designer, I fully take advantage of programing zooming in/out for the scrolling, copy/paste buttons and much more. 

Maybe because the mouse is newer the side scroll has a little more friction when scrolling which I personally like more. 

The design of the mouse allows my full hand to rest comfortably on the entire mouse. This essentially ruins me when I try to use the traditional mouse that is less comfortable and makes me long for my logitech master 3s.

The only downfall is the USB-A bolt receiver, as it is incompatible with the other logitech devices and I would have to use a USB-A to C converter. Waiting on logitech to finally give us the USB-c. But overall no connection issues with the receiver or through Bluetooth.

Overall, logitech never fails to deliver."

  string(3266) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech doesn't need any introduction and I have been an avid user of Logitech computer accessories for as long as I can remember. I have been working as a Mechanical Design Engineer for more than 10 years now and Logitech is the only brand that I use for my mouse. I spend 90% of my time at job using mouse to 3D design stuff on software such as Creo, NX and SolidWorks. I cannot even imagine using any other brand mouse. I started with G602 that had 9 programmable buttons and anyone with even a little design experience can understand how much of a life saver that mouse is. Unfortunately, that started giving some issues after more than 5 years of service and I replaced it with MX Master 2S and OMG, that was a game a changer too. I agree, it didn't have as much programmable buttons but I still was able to make full use of few that are provided.

The MX Master 2S was a fantastic mouse, but I had two complaints about it: 1) It used Micro USB instead of Type C and 2) the thumb wheel and navigation buttons were hard to use. The MX Master 3S fixes both those problems. The thumb wheel now has a very high quality feel to it and is very easy to spin around, and they've moved the navigation buttons lower down to make them easier to press with your thumb. The main scroll wheel has also been made quieter, and somehow even more fun to use. As before, this mouse works on pretty much all surfaces, can connect to 3 devices, and can connect by either bluetooth or a USB dongle. I've had no issues using it on both a Mac and PC. Logitech claims a battery life of 70 days, and while I obviously haven't been able to test that out yet, if the MX Master 2S is anything to go by, you can expect great battery life on this mouse too. The 3S has significantly better placement for my average sized hands. On the 2S, it required pulling my thumb so far back, that it initially felt like my thumb was going to dislocate. On the 3S that isn’t a problem.

The vertical scroll wheel is great. Feels much better than the scroll wheel on the 2S, but it may take some fiddling with the Logitech Options program to get it to automatically switch to free scrolling based on your desired speed. The default setting switches it too easily, and the jump from ratcheted scrolling to free scrolling speed is significant. You might find yourself wanting to just scroll a few lines faster, and then suddenly you’re all the way at the bottom of a webpage.

It's a big upgrade from Master 2S. However, if you own a Master 3, getting a 3S would not be much of an upgrade for you. The only difference between the two are that 3S has a 8000 DPI sensor where as 3 has 4000 DPI sensor. The other difference is that Logitech claims that 3S has 90% quieter clicking than 3.

There is no question the placement of the back and forward buttons has been improved as well as the horizontal scrolling wheel as compared to 2S. The tracking also seems more precise. The gesture button is also vastly improved and now has an actual physical button. This mouse unequivocally earns a high five stars rating from me, along with my honest and very hearty recommendation. You will never see a mouse more ergonomic and comfortable to use than this one!"

  string(2772) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the original MX Master since it came out a few years ago as my daily driver for work. I have also skipped the past versions as well. So, on first impressions, the fundamental design remains almost the same. It is still for right-handed people, the thumb rests comfortable on the rubber “winglet”, it promotes a “palm rest” use, and has similar weight. There are also significant changes. The side-scroll wheel is larger, the back-forward buttons are now below it, and the scroll wheel is larger and all metal. I will say that I do prefer the back-forward buttons on the side as they seem a bit out of place under the side-wheel. The right-left buttons are smaller but are pushed forward a bit more and the right one protrudes further. I had to get used to it, but it only took a few hours before things became second nature. Overall, I find the ergonomics comfortable for my medium-sized hands.

I tried connecting via USB-C wired, Bluetooth, and the included 2.4Ghz receiver across a Windows laptop, an iOS tablet, and an Android tablet. All connected properly with no issues.  Switching between them is a breeze by pressing the buttons below the mouse. According to Logitech, the battery life can last for 70 days, and it seems that this may be true since I’ve been using it for days and it still shows up as full. Plus, the mouse features quick-charging where 1 minute provides 3 hours of use -very nice!

The buttons and wheels are very responsive, and I am grateful that they are very quiet -useful while late night browsing! The underside allows for easy gliding across several surfaces (hard or soft). The mouse is easy to pick up and drop easily as well. While I might not be fully sold on the placement of the forward-back buttons, they make it easy to move between web pages. Since I work heavily with spreadsheets and data, the MagSpeed scroll wheel is of great benefit. The same goes with the side-scroll wheel. Managing long websites, text, and video editing becomes so much easier. 

Just in case the stock settings do not do it for you, Logitech provides the Logi Options app, where you can easily customize the buttons, add macros, adjust the gesture button and scroll wheels specific to the software or program, and even device being used. I especially appreciate changing the DPI. There you can manage all compatible Logi devices as well. 

At the end of the end Logitech has got a great thing going with the MX Master series. While there’s nothing wrong with the original, I am glad that now the MX Master 3s features USB-C, great battery life, and super quiet buttons. It may be pricier than other options, but what it brings to the table is well worth it in my opinion."

  string(3131) "Finally - All the features of MX series with softer clicks and newer wireless tech, and improved tracking on shiny/glass surfaces!

I'm already a BIG fan of the MX series, owning a full-size MX Mechanical keyboard and a separate Craft keyboard for my second workstation at my desk (for my creative work!). I also have both an MX Master 3 and an MX Vertical mouse, and the MX Anywhere portable mouse for travel (spoiler alert, I'm a Logitech peripheral fan!). 

Alas, I loved the MX series, but the MX Master 3 (and the MX Master and MX Master 2 I owned before it) all suffered from very loud click sounds from the primary left and right mouse buttons. Some people like the click, but those people aren't married to my wife! :)

The MX Master 3S is the perfect companion to my new MX Mechanical keyboard - Its smoothness doesn't disappoint. ALL of the MX Master features are here, including customizability, scrolling control (choice between stopped/clutched and smooth scrolling and compatibility with Logitech's own receiver format, and bluetooth PCs, tablets, phones and other compute devices.

There are a few quirks as well, mostly due to a generational leap that Logitech is making across the MX series starting with the Master 3S and MX Mechanical:

 - This mouse is NOT compatible with Logitech's UNIFYING receivers that they've been including with peripherals for YEARS now. They have upgraded it to a new technology called Logitech BOLT which will replace UNIFYING in their lineup. BOLT has some technical advantages, such as reduced USB bandwidth and I believe better coverage/reduced latency but this will disappoint those who are only upgrading one peripheral and expected backwards compatibility with their other desktop components. BOLT is the new UNIFYING at Logi, but you'll need to upgrade everything to take advantage. BOLT devices can't work with a UNIFYING receiver, and UNIFYING compatible devices won't work with a BOLT receiver. Its a lose-lose on compatibility. Thankfully Bluetooth is Bluetooth and supports all, but if you use the receivers, you'll need two to support mixed old/new standards.

 - Just as with the hardware, the software is being replaced also- Gone is support for Logitech Options, the keyboard and mouse customization software for the rest of the MX series, to be replaced by Logitech Options+, which gets nary a mention on their Options website. I spent about 30 minutes troubleshooting how I had the latest version of Options and STILL couldn't see my MX Master 3S in its configuration screen. The good news here is that Options+ DOES support many of the older MX series items also, so upgrading to it in a mixed estate should be no problem.

All in all this is a generational change, which will delight some and infuriate others, but I'm so happy to have this device, as well as the rest of the EXCELLENT MX Series, in the stable. I loved it so much I went out and added an MX Mechanical to the set (which I will review separately) just to have everything on my station on BOLT and Options+ and to take advantage of its improvements. The new MX Series devices are worthy of the name!"

I normally use a trackpad with my Mac, but wanted to give the Logitech mouse a spin. The build quality is excellent and the configurability options are almost endless. You can literally change every button and the scroll wheels to do almost anything you want when picking from a very long list of possibilities. Although the default options for each button/scroll wheel make the most sense, I changed a few to suit my needs and workflow better. The only real issue I had and I have with any of these Logitech products is the software. It tends to be a bit buggy, especially at the time of original installation. I already had Logitech Options installed on my Mac, but to use this mouse ones needs Options+. The Options software told me I needed to update to Options+, but didn't tell me how. Any other software will have an "update" option in one of the drop down menus, but Options did not. After about 15 minutes of trying to figure out what to do, I finally realized I just need to go the website and download the latest version of regular Options after which I would be guided to update to Options+. None of that made any sense, but I finally got it figured out. However, I can imagine someone who is not as techy as me would probably need to contact Logitech support."

Pros:
Build quality
Comfort
Performance
Style
Ease of use
Customization
Battery life
Bluetooth or USB wireless
Cons:
Dongle is USB-A only

Unboxing / setup:
The package is small and has the essentials, the mouse, a dongle (USB-A) and warranty info. Setup is easy. With the dongle you can just plug it into the system and the mouse is automatically paired. If you want to connect via bluetooth, long press the connection button on the bottom and pair via your computer. I highly recommend you install the Logitech software from the website as it will allow you to customize buttons/wheels with specific programs such as excel, photoshop and more.

Build quality:
The quality of this device is outstanding. It uses some sort of magnetic scrolling so the wheels feel buttery smooth. Button clicks are good and the device feels sturdy.

Use: 
I test with a windows laptop, a Mac Mini and a Galaxy Tab 8 Ultra in Dex mode. All devices are easily supported or paired to the mouse. The PC and mac allow for 8k DPI mode which for me was a bit too fast but for some will allow insane amounts of accuracy. The scroll wheels are very useful, especially the horizontal wheel. On Mac it is great for scrolling through books, magazines and more whereas in productivity software it is great for navigation on spreadsheets, moving around zoomed photos and so on. The thumb rest area has a hidden button that you can use for multiple things. I use it for selection between open windows similar to alt-tab. 

Bluetooth seemed a little laggy to me in comparison to using the dongle but it was still useful. The USB-A dongle was a non issue for me but if you are using this with a device that is only equipped with USB-C this might be an issue without an adapter."

Until just recently, Logitech still hadn’t optimized the Intel based software for the Logitech Options App (the app you use to program functionality on the mouse) to run on the Silicone ARM technology of a MacBook Pro, so sadly, even with Logitech Technical support help, I had to return it. 

To Logitech’s credit, days after returning the mouse they sent me an updated link they said would work with an MX Master 3 on a Silicon ARM Based MacBook Pro. I stored the link hoping I’d get another opportunity to use a MX Master.  That day came when I got the newest MX Master 3s.  So, did it work?  Yes, yes it did!  Using the updated Logitech Options Installer, it installed perfectly, and I was able to program the mouse to my specific needs.  To say I’m a Happy Camper is an understatement.

Now that I’ve gotten the pre-story out of the way, let’s talk about this mouse.  If you’ve never had the pleasure of owning a Logitech MX Master Mouse, you simply have no idea what you’re missing.  It may seem odd to wax enthusiastic over a mouse, but the MX Master is worthy of such praise.  And this newest MX Master 3s even more so.

It’s now even more ergonomic.  It just fits your hand so perfectly.  It’s made of premium plastics (recycled to save the planet) and this version doesn’t show fingerprints.  They come with a battery which lasts a LONG time.  A very LONG time.  The new MX Master 3s can go up to 70 days on a single charge.  My original MX Master lasted a long time as well, so I have every expectation the 3s will live up to what Logitech claims.

You need to go to Logitech.com and download the Logitech Options App. It is very easy to use and lets you customize so many aspects of the mouse.  You can change the pointer speed.  You can Program the second scroll wheel on the side of the mouse.  I use it as volume up and down.  You have two buttons underneath the second scroll wheel, which I have programmed as forward and back.  And there’s yet another button where your thumb rests, which I’ve set up for Universal Control.  You can choose from many other options to suit your workflow.

The primary scroll wheel is magical.  There’s the traditional mouse click we’re all used to.  And a tap of the button behind the wheel, releases what Logitech calls Magspeed.  The wheel is magnetic and has no, none, zip friction.  You can scroll faster than you’ve ever scrolled before.  And the scroll wheel also can be clicked and programmed for a number of functions.  I have mine programmed to zoom, which is very cool.

The mouse can be paired with up to three different devices and all you need to do is tap the pairing button on the bottom of the mouse to switch between paired devices.  This mouse can scan up to 8000 DPI, for ultra-smooth and accurate scrolling.  The mouse can connect with Windows, Chrome, Linux, iPadOS , Android and MacOS.  And if you don’t have Bluetooth, it does come with a USB Receiver.  One of the best upgrades over previous MX Master Mice is how unbelievably quiet the 3s is.  You can’t hear the wheels scroll.  More importantly, you can’t hear the right or left mouse clicks.  How refreshing to have a mouse which does so much, yet so incredibly quiet.  

If you haven’t gathered from what I’ve written, I’m quite enamored with the Logitech MX Master 3s.  They took everything that was already good in previous MX Master Mice and improved it significantly.  And now, I’m able to use it on a MacBook Pro M1 Pro Silicon ARM Based laptop.  Is it worth the price of admission?  Yes, yes it is.  Just get one.  You simply won’t regret it."

  string(2085) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This has got to be the most comfortable mouse I have ever used.  It may cost well above the price of your typical, run-of-the-mill regular mouse, but it is well worth it.  When they say "ultrafast scrolling" they mean it.  No more zig-zagging up and down and left and right all over the place next to your keyboard.  You just move the mouse a small distance and the cursor is there, just where you want it, in a fraction of the time.  The scrolling and movement, both on the screen and physically with the mouse, is as smooth as butter.  


The ergonomics of the mouse is superb.  I am not exaggerating when I say that it is so comfortable.  The soft, rubbery-feeling thumb rest placement combined with the natural curvature of the mouse itself makes for an almost cloud-like, pillowy feel when you place your hand upon it.  It's not too tall, not too short.  The customizable buttons, both on the side by the thumb rest and on top, are in perfect placement, as are the scroll wheels.  


And the sound--the clicking is virtually silent, it's so quiet.  You do get the satisfying click sound so you know the click was registered, but it is very subtle.  It pairs via Bluetooth or USB receiver; I utilized Bluetooth pairing, which was seamless and quick.  It also charges via a USB-A to USB-C charging cable that is included--no messing around with batteries.  I tried this mouse with several of my own devices as well as others' in my household--my iMac and iPads, my husband's Samsung and ASUS laptops, my kids' Dell and Chromebook laptops and desktops, etc.  All the different operating systems and web browsers worked well with this mouse, as did the switching between devices.  (So I could switch seamlessly between my iMac and iPad, or from our Dell desktop to one of our laptops, etc.  It can be paired simultaneously with up to three devices.)  


Among the several mice we've had over the years, from different brands and different kinds and at different price points, this is definitely one of the best.  Highly recommended."

  string(1239) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the original MX Master mouse for a handful of years.  I use it daily, especially since working from home for the past couple years.  It is not a high-performance gaming mouse.  It does not have 15,000 dpi, a sub 60g weight, or on-the-fly dpi switching.  What it does have is incredible battery life, ergonomics, and the best scroll wheel I have ever used.  This new 3S model takes everything I love about daily driving the MX Master for work, and adds to it.  Button presses still have a positive bump, but the switches are near silent.  No more click-clacking around a spreadsheet.  The buttons are super quiet.  The shape has changed a bit and does not feel as wide as my original MX, but it is still every bit as comfortable.  It's a joy to use on a daily basis, with a good weight for productivity tasks.  It's a heavier mouse, but again this is not an ultralight gaming mouse, which is fine.  Also, this new model charges via USB-C instead of the micro-USB on the older model, which is always a welcome change.  Overall I would highly recommend this new MX model for anybody looking for a high quality comfortable mouse that does not need to be charged very often."

  string(1608) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you're familiar with the MX Master line of mice, then this will be entirely familiar. It was already a good product, but Logitech has still managed to find way to tweak the design. First, the Logo Options + software is now out of beta, and the minor issues have been fixed. Besides giving you enhanced ability to redefine what each button does, the software also allows you to assign functions to buttons depending on which app you're currently using. So, for example, the side scroll wheel could switch between tabs in your browser but scroll side to side in your Excel workbooks. The main applications that come with preset tailored functions are Chrome, Edge, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, and Word, but you can add just about any application on your computer for customized settings. The main scroll wheel still does its thing where it will sense when you're trying to scroll a lot and start to spin freely for extended scrolling. You can also turn that "clicking" off and on for the scroll wheel just by clicking it, but I found that it still scrolls in small jumps on the screen, so I prefer to leave those magnetic "clicks" on for regular use. I also really appreciate the presence of that side scroll wheel over having to use buttons or push the center scroll wheel side to side. It's just better ergonomically. And overall, the ergonomics of the mouse are still superb. The main left and right click buttons are quieter, as advertised, but I'm not sure how important that really is. If you haven't updated your mouse in awhile, this is good option."

  string(1592) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used every iteration of the MX Master series mice and was looking forward to getting this newest version. It definitely does not disappoint, and I highly recommend this mouse.
Packaging is typical for Logitech and refreshingly simple.  It comes with the mouse, USC C charging cable and the Logi Bolt USB receiver (I have never needed this for any version of this mouse as I connect via Bluetooth).
The only issue I came across was with setting this mouse up.  I had been using the MX master 2S mouse for a year and it connected immediately.  This one took about 20 minutes as my 3 month $2700 laptop would not pair with the product. I then tried to connect through the Logi Options software but came to find out this mouse needed a different software called Logi Options + in order to unwrap all the great features, assign buttons, etc. Had to remove Logi Options, install Logi Options +, then reboot and then it connected quickly. It would have been nice to know it needed a different software from the beginning – would have saved a lot of time.  
Operation of this mouse is flawless and unbelievably works on ANY surface, even a clear glass top table. Programming the buttons through the software was simple and of course you can change the speeds of the cursor movement as well as the 2 buttons near the thumb under the thumb scroll to your liking.  Ergonomically, this is the best feeling, most comfortable mouse of the MX series. 
Overall – I highly recommend this mouse as it does what it touts and does it extremely well."

  string(1856) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Truly one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used. I've been using Logitech's MX Master Mouse 2 for a few years now, and I've had nothing but good experience with it. This updated version is no different. The first thing that really jumps out at you is just how quiet it is. While you may not necessarily think about how loud mouse clicks are, this mouse will make you realize just how loud they used to be. Each click feels great but is very quiet. It's almost inaudible. That's not to say that there's any question as to whether you've clicked though, it is still very easy to tell when you've clicked the buttons, they're just almost silent. The material of the mouse is very nice too. It has an almost soft touch feel that's very nice. That along with the quietness gives the mouse a very premium feel. The position of the side wheel has taken a little getting used to, as I was so used to the MX Master Mouse 2, and this one is positioned a bit higher it seems. If you've used an MX Master before, you'll know they also have this great feature of where you can kind of spin the middle mouse button wheel quickly and it will switch from a click-y type of scrolling to a free-moving wheel for quicker scrolling. This new one has the same option, but again, the operation of the switch between types is very quiet. It has other great features too, like being able to connect to 3 different devices and quickly switching between them. Logitech's software for customizing the mouse is also great and easy to use. If there is anything that I can maybe complain about with this mouse, is that the soft touch material is kind of a magnet to dust and fuzz.

Pros: Premium feel, extremely quiet, very precise and responsive, great software and customization

Cons: Soft touch can be a magnet for dust/fuzz"

  string(2304) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m a big fan of Logitech computer accessories and I have owned a bunch of their MX line of products. I currently use the MX Master 2S and still working great for me. I expect the same from this next generation MX Master and it hasn’t disappointed me.

It now uses USB-C instead of microUSB for charging. The charging port is still located on the front of the mouse so you can use it while it is charging not like the Apple mouse. It lost the 3 LED battery level indicator that was on the 2S which was helpful and it is now replaced with one LED battery indicator. The location of the two side buttons is moved to just under the side scroll wheel. The button click is virtually noiseless. It is that quiet. The scroll wheel in the ratchet mode is also quieter than the previous. It is also faster and more precise.

It works on any surface with the upgraded 8000 DPI sensor compared to the 2S that had 4000 DPI.  You can customize the sensitivity through the app. Whether it be wood, metal, cloth, mousepad or even my glass sliding door, it works on all of those surfaces. The glide strips makes for a very smooth movement across the surface. 

I am using this mouse on Apple devices and they have this feature called Universal Control which lets you use one keyboard and mouse to control your Apple devices simultaneously. With Logitech Options+ and this Flow enabled mouse, you can now control a Mac and Windows computers with one mouse. You can transfer files, copy on one and paste on the other. Wait what? Mac and Windows working together? Yep It’s true! This Logi Flow cross-computer control works pretty seamless too but I think Apple’s Universal Control is more seamless. It still has the ability to connect to three different devices with the easy switch button on the bottom of the mouse

The ergonomic design feels the same as the 2S and the build quality is just as good. The color scheme changed from a gray two tone to a black two tone. The scroll wheels no longer have the rubber outer layer but it doesn’t affect the grip in my opinion. This Master 3S looks and feels great and it works great too.

It comes with a Logi Bolt USB receiver and a USB-A to USB-C cable. This mouse is not compatible with the USB Unifying receiver."

  string(1902) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Right off the bat I can honestly say that I recommend this upgraded Logitech MX Master 3S Wireless Laser Mouse with Ultrafast Scrolling being it's made by Logitech.

Inside the package is the new upgraded MX Master 3S mouse, Bolt USB receiver, and USB-C charging cable and user documentation. The Bolt receiver is resemblance to the Unifying Receiver from the last model, however, this connects via Logitech Options+ software and not the regular Logitech Options software. The mouse itself is identical to its older sibling the MX Master 3 Wireless Laser Mouse, that I reviewed a couple years ago. On looks alone, everything looks the same.

Simply pop the Bolt USB Receiver into a free USB port on your laptop/desktop and its ready to go. However, its recommended to download and install the Logitech Options+ software as stated above. This allows you to tweak the settings to your liking. The build quality is solid and sturdy as we've all come to love about Logitech products.

In this upgraded model, Logitech fined tuned an already awesome wireless laser mouse with ultrafast scrolling and made it better. Precision and movement is like buttery smooth. The DPI is now 8000 compared to 4000 and the left and right button clicks are ever so quiet. In the MX Master 3 you can hear and audible click when you press down on the buttons, but on the 3S there's no click sound. This was the first thing I noticed after I got everything installed and loaded. My favorite feature on both the 3 and 3S is that ultrafast flywheel. You can spin that scroll wheel as if you're on The Price is Right, or you can press the button below the scroll wheel and switch the wheel mode into more of a line by line scroll. This mouse can also be connected via Bluetooth instead of the Bolt USB receiver. Bluetooth mode is great for when I want to connect it to my iPad."

  string(1117) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Coming from an MX Master 2S, the 3S is a very good upgrade.  The main button action is softer, the scroll wheels are fluid, and the DPI settings are ultrafine and ultrafast...and probably way more than I need.  Overall, the mouse is incredibly comfortable in the hand and button placement is intuitive.  If there is one thing I would love for Logitech to bring back would be a main scroll when that also moves side-to-side.

This is a rechargeable mouse and I'm happy that it includes USB-C for the charging port (as opposed to micro-USB.)

Control of the mouse uses the updated Logi Options +, and I'm happy to see this updated software covers all of the basics in a simpler interface and gives many button/wheel configuration options.  Some older Logitech peripherals are not yet compatible with Options +.

One other thing:  This mouse can connect via Bluetooth or the newer Logi Bolt receiver (as opposed to the Unifying receiver.). I'm not sure it this receiver is backwards compatible, but it appears all of Logitech's newer peripherals are making the switch."

  string(1832) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been a fan of logitech mice for quite some time. They are of great quality and work/fit well in almost every scenario, My current m9use is the MX2 Anywhere mouse which is perfect for my on-the-go/work laptop. However, my desktop still needed a quality mouse to use with and this one fit the bill perfectly. 

The ergonomics of this mouse is pretty much perfect for my hands. I have Med/Lrg sized hands so the contours of this mouse just fit great for me and the buttons are all within reach for my fingers. 

Connectivity is pretty standard fare here so you can connect with the USB dongle or via bluetooth. I don't know why but it would be really great if Logitech would incorporate some place to put the USB dongle in the mouse when not in use. Would really mean a lot since I seem to always lose the USB dongle for my other mice. 

Fit/feel of this mouse is great. The L/R buttons are almost silent when pressed and the configurable buttons are well within comfortable reach of your hand. You can program the buttons as you see fit so there's lots of customization there. Scrolling is fantastic with this mouse and customizable as well. 

There is a multi-device connection feature on this mouse however I haven't been able to test it as of yet. With this, you're able to pair the mouse to several different devices, laptops, tablets, etc., and use one mouse across all of them. Sounds like a great idea however, for now, I haven't been able to utilize this feature as of yet. 

Overall, a great mouse for for your needs and especially if you have larger than normal sized hands. The side scrolling button is a bit weird for me only in the sense that I've never had a mouse with this. It'll take some time getting used to but definitely a nice added feature on this mouse."

For some reason in 2022, Logitech appears to be the only brand with mice on the market that tracks on glass. So if you have a glass table to use your mouse on like I do, and don't want to use a mouse pad, Logitech's MX series of mice appear to be your only option. Thankfully, Logitech does an amazing job with the MX Master line making it feel like a premium device that it's worth.

Thanks to its ergonomic design, it never feels uncomfortable using the MX Master 3S. It's tall enough and curved in the right way to allow your hand and fingers to naturally rest on it. The soft rubberized texture of the base provides a comfortable feel. I've used the mouse all day and my wrist never feels tired from it.

What's new to the MX Master 3S that was absent from the Master MX 3 that preceded it are the silent left and right click buttons. What was once the loudest parts of mouse, on the 3S it's now the most quietest. The amazing thing is, it still feels tactile. It doesn't feel mushy or suppressed. You'll feel the click like you always do. It's just A LOT less noisy. The change is so dramatic that you may hate initially, like I did. I wanted a silent mouse, but when I first used the 3S I instantly felt regret and frustration. My brain was so used to expecting a sound when I click that when I didn't with the 3S it felt extremely jarring to me. I think I may have been clicking harder than I needed to out of reflex. Fortunately, within a half hour, maybe an hour at most, I got used to the silent click and wound up falling in love with it like I thought it would. Oh my GOD, I *WISH* I had this 20 years when I was up using a computer during late hours when my parents expected me in bed.
The left/right click buttons aren't the only thing that's gone quieter. The scroll wheel is also a lot more quiet, even in ratchet mode, where the wheel has tactile "steps" when you spin it.
The back/forward side buttons are also relatively quiet.
All in all this mouse seems to be designed to work quietly. The loudest part of the mouse is probably the thumb button.

None of the buttons feel cheap. They all have a pleasant tactile responsive feel. No soft mushy feel. No sticky feel.
The thumb button is easier to find and on the MX Master 3S than the 2S and older because it has a very slight bump to help feel your way to locating it. It also feels easier to press because there is now a groove on the side of the mouse to allow the button to be pressed deeper. You won't accidentally press it while resting your thumb there because of where the button is placed, in the center of the base of mouse on the left side. It's hard for me to explain. It's not easy to press the button by accident, but it's easy to press the button when you need to.

There are 2 wheels on the mouse, the scroll wheel in between the left/right click buttons for scrolling with your index finger, and the thumb wheel on the side for scrolling with your thumb. There is no longer the rubberized coating on the wheels but they still have a good feel to them. I like this change as I imagine the wheel will be easier to clean over time as it collects dirt and grime. The rubber from the older versions made it tougher to clean as dirt would stick to it. Now it's just all steel.
The thumb scroll wheel is now placed above the back/forward buttons instead of beside them.
Thanks to this, the thumb scroll wheel is in its own row and the wheel is now wider making it more easier to use than ever before.
The scroll wheel has SmartShift, which automatically switches the scroll wheel from line-by-line scrolling to hyper-fast scrolling when you scroll faster.
Or you can use the Shift wheel mode button below the scroll wheel to switch between Ratchet (tactile steps) and Free spin (no tactile steps) immediately.

With the use of Logitech's Options+ software, the mouse is extremely customizable. Every button on the mouse can be remapped. You can even map buttons for specific applications only, instead of making the changes global.
With Options+ you can also change the speed of both wheels, as well as change the direction of the scrolling of the wheels.
You can also change the pointer speed by changing the sensor range. The range is from 200DPI to 8000DPI by steps of 50 DPI. The default DPI out of the box, and without the Options+ software is 1000DPI. I found 8000DPI way too fast and frenetic for me to be precise with it with my use case, even though I have a 3 monitor setup with 4K monitors, but this may be helpful for others with a more expensive setup like a multi-monitors using 8K monitors which have twice as many pixels, making the average mouse pointer feel slower with the default sensor. The higher DPI sensor would allow the mouse pointer speed to move faster.
The Options+ software is also where you can set up the MX Master 3S with Flow. Flow allows you to use and control multiple computers with Options+ also installed seamlessly. Switch to another computer by simply moving your cursor to the edge of the screen. Flow also allows your to copy and paste content between those computers. However, since Flow is dependent on the Options+ software, it's only compatible with Windows and MacOS. So there is no first-party solution from Logitech for Linux, Android, or iOS.

Whereas "MX" meant the mouse employs Darkfield technology to allow tracking on virtually any surface, the "Master" means the mouse is able to pair with up to 3 devices. With a button found under the mouse, you can switch between those 3 devices. Out of the box, "1" is paired to the included Bolt receiver.
What may comes as unfortunate news to loyal Logitech users is that the Bolt receiver is not compatible with devices that use the older Unifying receiver. First introduced with Logitech's business line of products, it was designed to be more secure and perform better under busy environments that would typically cause interference with the wireless connection. Typically when this happens, users are advised to get a USB extension cable to connect the USB receiver to, so you can bring it closer to the mouse for a more reliable connection. In theory, Bolt should help prevent this. Unfortunately, I'm not in an environment with that kind of interference so I can't test this claim.

Logitech claims it has a battery life of *up to* 70 days, carefully wording it so that 70 days is their claim max point. So don't expect 70 days. The reality is, how long it lasts will vary depending on the user and how they use it. For example, with me, I'm on the computer almost all day and night, over 8 hours a day. I haven't owned the 3S long enough to test its battery life in real time to see it go from 100% to 0% but I've seen it lose 10% of battery in my 3 days of use. That would amount to about 30 days, which is the same amount of battery life I got with my MX Master 2S, which Logitech also claimed "up to 70 days". So, if you're a previous MX Master 2S or Master 3 user, expect the same amount of battery life as that. To me, this is very good battery life, as I'm an abnormal user. I spend way too much time on the computer. Perhaps the average user will get 45-50 days out of it. For someone like my mom, who is elderly and not on the computer as much, 70 days is definitely possible. This is thanks to how power efficient the mouse is. It goes into sleep mode after a long period of inactivity. I have never felt the need to power my mouse off.

The mouse charges via USB-C, and Logitech claims 3 minutes of charging will give you about a full day's worth of use.I haven't been able to test this yet because I'm still working with the initial charge that it came with out of the box, which was 45%. In 5 days of use, I've only lost a reported 10%.
That's a notable thing about the battery reporting with the MX Master 3S. You can only see the battery percentage through the Options+ app or bluetooth if you have it connected via bluetooth. And it only reports the battery percentage in intervals of 5%. So the 35% battery I'm seeing now actually means 31% to 35%.

The battery indicator on the MX Master 3S is just a single LED, albeit larger and easier to see. On the MX 2S and older, there were 3 LEDs so you could see the battery level. With one LED, you can now only see whether the battery is above 10% (green), below 10% (red), or charging (blinking). I honestly don't think this is that bad because when it turns red, that's your reminder to charge it or else it will die. And being in the red with 10% will give you 3 days of extensive usage to do it, which is plenty of time.

For loyal MX Master mouse users coming from the 2S or older, you may be in for a real unpleasant shock from all the changes they've made to the 3S. But give it time and you'll fall in love with it like I did. Bolt is the future, and Unifying will get phased out. Got to start somewhere. 3S is a great start."

  string(6798) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I want to talk about the Logitech MX Master 3S Mouse in two parts:  as a mouse first and foremost and then with regard to its particular features.

Mice have been around for a long time, and just like people are always trying to build a better mousetrap, they’re also always trying to build a better mouse.  The “original” modern mouse, if you want to call it that, and I do, can be traced back to the kidney-shaped, two-button, Microsoft Serial Ball Mouse.  Everything since then has been an improvement, or an attempt to improve, on this basic design.  Most mice since then have stayed with the standard oval or kidney shape, and most of these can work for either right- or left-handed people.

Later mice have incorporated useful things like more buttons which can be separately programmed, scroll wheels, and a change from mechanical to optical tracking.  But most improvements nowadays are incremental.  The mouse clicks are a little quieter.  The scroll-wheel is more sensitive.  The tracking sensor is more precise.  There are extra buttons for customization.  Connection can be by more different ways now, too, like USB and Bluetooth, and wireless mice are now everywhere. 

But it’s still a mouse.  So let’s start with the basics.  This mouse starts off being very non-standard by being specifically designed for right-handed people.  It is highly non-symmetrical, with a large, low flange on the left side to hold your thumb. You can actually rest your thumb on this while using the mouse, not that keeping your thumb off the table is very difficult or tiring with a more conventional mouse.  But still, the little thumb support ledge feels just a bit more comfortable to hold.

This is not a small mouse.  There are mice that tout that they are for small hands or large hands, and I’ve used both.  I have large hands, and large-hand mice, while not all that much larger, really, than “regular” mice, do feel slightly more comfortable.  As it sits on the table, the mouse is angled downward to the right, so your index finger sits a little above your middle finger. This shape conforms better to the natural shape of your hand, and, again, makes this mouse just a little more comfortable to hold and use.

Overall, as a basic mouse, the MX Master 3S succeeds and then some. It is very comfortable to hold and has a nice heft and feel to it.  

Now lets get to the specifics of this mouse.

1.  The claim is that it can track on any surface.  As any seasoned optical mouse user surely knows, optical mice typically have a hard time with reflective or clear surfaces such as glass.  I encounter this problem often when traveling and am sitting at the desk in the hotel room, and the desk has a glass platen over the top of it to protect the wood finish.  Unless I remember to bring a mouse pad with me, which I never do, I end up having to get something opaque like a magazine or a folded newspaper and run the mouse over that.  This mouse eliminates this problem, a welcome feature.  To add to the benefit, the sensor is 8000 DPI and is customizable, making scrolling on any surface, glass or otherwise, more efficient.

2.  Less click noise.  Not really a big deal.  I compared the click noise on this mouse with my previous mouse and the collection of mice I have in my cabinet.  None of them make much of a click noise, and I think the last time this was an issue was about 1990.  

3.  Fast scrolling.  Yes, the main scroll wheel between the two main button is large, sculpted, and easy to use.  Sometimes I need to quickly get to page 16 of a 35 page Word document, and being able to scroll quickly to get there is greatly appreciated.

4.  Customizable buttons.  To access this, you need to download and install the Logi Options+ software.  Customizable buttons are nothing new, and having to download software to program them is also nothing newr.  In addition to the two main mouse buttons and scroll wheel, there are two buttons, one in front of the other, just above where your thumb sits, a smaller scroll wheel just above those two buttons, also designed to be operated by your thumb, and a much smaller button just behind the main scroll wheel.  Program these for your favorite software.  I have to admit that I’ve never been much of a mouse button programmer for the simple reason that I can never remember what I programmed a particular button to do.  If I did some action often enough in some piece of software, I could see programming a button to quicken this process, but I normally don’t.  But it’s there if I need it.

5.  Connectivity is by USB or Bluetooth.  In both situations, the mouse can be programmed to work with up to three different devices.  Being able to use the same mouse at home on my desktop and then away from home on my laptop can be particularly useful if I have programmed one or more buttons to work with specific software.  I just have to remember to take the mouse with me when I travel!  The mouse can be also be connected to different operating environments, such as Window OS on this computer MacOS on that computer, Linux on another computer, and so forth.  This can be very handy for some people.

One thing that threw me for a loop briefly when I first took the mouse out of the box was powering it. I assume I would have to insert one or maybe two AA batteries, which is common for wireless mice.  But I quickly found that there was no battery compartment, and a quick check of the box revealed that the battery is permanent and is rechargable through a USB-C port on the front edge of the mouse.  There is no mention of this in the paper documentation, only on the exterior of the box.  It says that a one-minute charge yields three hours of use while a full-charge can last 70 days.  I have not tested the latter claim, and I decided to simply charge the mouse for an hour before using it the first time.  I’ve been using it since then for about four days, and I’ve had no power issues.  I do switch the mouse off when not using it to conserve battery life.  A USB-2 to USB-C cable is included, so the mouse can be charged from most any USB-2 wall adapter, not to mention a computer with a USB-2 port.  I used my cell-phone’s USB-C wall charger and cable to charge this mouse.  While not intended to be accessed regularly, instructions are provided on removing the lithium battery should it ever need to be replaced.


This mouse has become my main mouse. I would like it if it had nothing more than the unusual, hand-shaped design with thumb rest.  I have used unusually-shaped mice before, but none have been comfortable enough to become my main mouse.  But this one is different.  Highly recommended if for no other reason than that.  The rest is gravy."

  string(1527) "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been using this new MX Master for the past couple days of work, syncing this both to my work computer and personal computer. I have the original MX Master from 2017 and its been nice noticing the upgrades and changes that have come along in the last 5 years. The form factor feels better in my hand and I like the visual aesthetic with some harder edges that the original. There were two major features that Logitech highlighted with the release of the 3S: Softer click buttons and a finer DPI laser that allows you to use the mouse on any surface. I'm not sure if I were buying this in a vacuum I would notice how soft the buttons are, but when comparing to the original Master the sound of clicking is night/day different and allows my to click around through documents while on calls without my mic picking it up. While I confess that I did not try the mouse on glass, I was really impressed with how smooth this mouse moves on cork, leather and wood. I feel confident that it would be smooth on any conference room table or office setup and allows you to move exactly where you want. 

In short this mouse will work with any device - I've connected it to my work ChromeOS and MacOS machines and my personal Windows 11 machine, provides high quality movement on any surface, is extremely (ALL DAY) comfortable in your hand, and has made notable improvements on what was already a great platform. I highly recommend this as the best mouse you can buy for a home office"

Infinite scroll is now magnetic, which is still great but less satisfying. There are very few buttons on this mouse, and if you are used to gaming mice, it is quite puzzling why there are so few for a mouse that doesn't really need to shave weight.

For what it is, I like it, but Logitech made the hump of the mouse too tall, and while you can get used to it, it's not ideal for me.

Incredible build quality! But the bolt connection is incompatible with all unifying receiver products (which are far more numerous).

I tried) The mouse click IS mostly silent, just as advertised. And there's a better sensor now. But literally nothing else has changed that matters. Get the non-S model instead.

- Black over Graphite. I don't know why but the black just looks more premium over the previous graphite version.
- Reduced clicking noise. The difference is VERY noticeable and I'm sure my co-workers appreciate my less  obnoxious clicking sounds.
- Improved DPI sensor. I've tested it on my glass table and it works well. Although I don't work on it often, it's nice to have the ability to use my mouse now and not have to use my laptop's awful trackpad."

  string(1019) "Coming from the Logitech MX Master mouse (which is still working and being used for my PC), the MS Master 3S was a nice addition, which is being used for my Mac. The two main differences compared to the Master 3 are the quiet clicks and the 8,000 DPI over the previous 4,000 DPI. It works well, and the horizontal scroll wheel is such a nice thing to have, especially in applications horizontal movement.

Two things that I'm not too fond of with the newer design is 
1.) The horizontal scroll wheel is recessed in slightly, making ever so slightly annoying to use. On the original MX, it was much more easier to access and use. 

2.) The thumb controls buttons are not as easy to use either (in my opinion). You have to extend your thumb to really reach the forward button. 

Other than that, it's worked well, with the quiet clicks being my most favorite feature of the mouse. There are other features as well that make it of more versatile use, and will continue to use the MX series if they keep up the good record."

  string(1336) "Great mouse, though not light-years beyond the MX3 model.  Ultra-high DPI is nice.

However, there is one huge flaw with this mouse - Logitech changed the wireless receiver standard from the Unifying spec to Logi Bolt.

The Bolt is supposed to be more secure and use Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is nice, but they did not make it backwards compatible with devices that connect via the Unifying receiver!  

Meaning, if you still use older Logitech hardware, you need to have two receivers connected to your laptop (where open USB ports may already be scarce).  In addition, I wanted to switch my mouse between my work and personal computers.  But now that this mouse only works with the Bolt, I would have to buy another Bolt receiver so I can interchange between the two machines.    *eye-roll*

Sadly, I didn't know that Logitech was releasing this new standard, and it isn't well advertised on the packaging that it uses the Bolt, so it's easy to get surprised.  I contacted Logitech Tech Support and there seems to no plan to make Bolt compatible with devices that connected via Unifying.

So, sadly I have to return this because the ability to switch the mouse between my machines on the fly was my main objective, and I refuse to buy another receiver because Logitech didn't think about making Bolt backwards compatible."

  string(1458) "my biggest qualms with the original MX Master 3 was the shrill, loud clicks and the fact that it came in a really ugly dark gray color alongside the horrendous native scrolling. i actually forced myself to use the magic mouse 2 for a while and through immeasurable pain because despite its awful shape, the magic mouse had really satisfying clicks and stupendously fluid scrolling.

but after only a few hours of use all i can say is i absolutely love this newer version of master 3. firstly, it fixes the loud annoying clicks in exchange for a very subtle, bass heavy thocky sound instead that i just love. seriously, i cannot stress enough how much a silent, more satisfying tacticle click makes a difference in workflow. my m1 macbook pro is already dead silent, and in conjunction with this mouse i'm basically working in absolute quiet.

as far as scrolling goes, logitech hasnt done much to resolve that issue but using a program called MOS in conjunction with Options+ SmoothScrolling option I've found a way to mimic the natural fluid scrolling of the magic devices, so i'm happy in that regard as well. if logitech could look into making smoothscroll better this mouse would be peak.

and finally, a truly black color. really the only way they could make this mouse better is if they provided a USBC dongle instead, but as is i'm really happy to be able to throw my magic mouse away and my hand is eternally grateful for the lack of pain forthcoming"

string(6314) "Take this List of reviews: 

- Great mouse.  It is comfortable to use and responsive.  I previously used the Apple mouse, and found this to be an improvement.

- Excellent mouse, best one I’ve ever owned in 40 years!

- Never had a mouse like this before, so glad I bought it.

- I normally don t write reviews but this mouse is SO amazing I figured I would.  The speed scroll is awesome, makes moving through large spreadsheet so much faster but allows to slow it down if you don t need that feature.  The side scrolling adds a whole other dimension of efficiency of time to my work day.  There is a big ROI with the cost of this mouse.  Worth every penny!

- So smooth way better than the Magic Mouse I’ve been using

- with the drafting programs i use this is a really nice product

- Had it for a couple weeks and its almost as good as my previous iteration of this same mouse from logitech. I say almost because this one doesnt sit as comfortably as my older one but its not too bad

- Love this product; it connects instantly and is customizable to your needs in terms of the what you want buttons to execute. I should have bought this years ago; but it is a bit pricey. I would definitely recommend this product.

- The best mouse ever!!! I love this mouse and I’m a Designer so I was very careful in looking for my next mouse and this is a must buy!

- Best invention ever!  Instead of using a separate mouse for my Mac and then plug in and unplug the usb to interchange between my home laptop and work laptop to use the mouse, this makes life so much easier.  I can interchange from my Mac to my home laptop and work laptop with a simple press of a button.  I highly recommend!!!

- Works great and quick for what I need.  After buying the Vertical ergonomic mouse for work, I feel the Vertical fits my hand better and there is less strain.  More expensive than vertical also.

- Comfortable. Quiet. Smooth. Impressive.There were two issues 1) quality control seems to be a bit of a problem. I ordered two of them and one was noticeably smoother than the other and just performed better. I d recommend that if you receive it and you like it but it feels like its just short of perfect then exchange it for another. You just might get one that works perfectly. 2) AVOID THE WHITE MODEL AT ALL COSTS. It changes to yellow after a few uses. Others have made the same comments. It seems to be an ongoing issue which reflects badly on this company that they would continue to distribute it. In any case, the white looks amazing but I am telling you... you need to avoid it anyway. It s really too bad because it was very sharp looking.

- Need a big grip? wanna free a USB port and connect via Bluetooth, wanna be able to add and edit features, customize buttons, look no more, this is it.

- The title says it all. My job software has a lot of drop down menus and boxes to click. The mouse is accurate and the click is soft and quiet. When your clicking a lot with a mouse that noise becomes very annoying.

- This mouse is like having three mice in one.  It has a preset button underneath it and allows you to change PCs at the touch of a button.  If desired, the mouse has a lot of configurable options via the Logitech software that you can download from their site for free.  It is not required for the mouse to work but it s there if you want to configure it to its fullest extent.

- The scroll wheel on this mouse is far and away the best I ve ever used, and I use the horizontal scroll wheel far more than i thought I would. My only complaints are there s not a spot to store the USB receiver in the mouse (not a huge deal since it can connect to 3 Bluetooth devices) and the mouse has no onboard memory. The lack of onboard memory is the bigger issue, as I can t install the Options+ app on my work PC, meaning I am unable to take full advantage of the mouse on the PC where the customizability would be most useful. But even without onboard memory this is my favorite mouse I ve used and I decided to keep it over the likes of the Logitech G604, Razer Basilisk, and JLab Epic Mouse.

- Mouse is great. Ergonomics are well designed and feel good. Connection is solid and fast (coming from usijg only gaming mice) but the issue is, the software slows the side scrolling down. Not sure why but when i delete the software the side scrolling returns to its smooth former self. With the software, side scrolling feels clunky and choppy. Such a bummer because you miss out on so many great perks of the software. Get the mouse, dont download the software.

- The best all-around mouse currently. Great for work, productivity, and just about everything. Not a top of the line mouse for gaming, but not bad. Overall, the best mouse on the market currently.

- For context: I m 6 4, large hands, and I use claw grip.I love how this fits my hand even though I use claw grip.  The setup was fairly simple, I had a few questions but the  buddy  software it launches during setup helped a lot.  At base level this mouse is already awesome, but where it shines is the customization with the logitech software it launches, everything from custom button mapping, sensitivity, speed, gesture+button combinations - it s really great.  Switching between sources is seamless as well.  Definitely a great buy!

- I have fairly large hands and this mouse is the most comfortable one to use with the added advantage that I can switch from my desktop to laptop with the touch of one button. You can use bluetooth direct to your device or through the dongle included

- Being a spreadsheet guru and needing a quick mouse this things is perfect

- Game changer .. this mouse have been very, very smooth, and effective comfortable than all other mouse that I have used before ..￼this is the best

- This mouse is fearure rich and can be customized across varying applications both in standard productivity programs as well as customized for gaming. Even works directly on glass!

- Its smooth, its ergonomic is awesome - i would refer my fnds

- Pricy but it’s worth it!  Absolutely love this and the Mx keys to go with it.

- This mouse by Logitech is great!! I purchased this a few weeks ago and I love it. Very easy to operate and I hooked it up to Bluetooth on my land line computer.

- The best mouse I have ever owned. I would recommend this mose to anyone and yes it will work on your Mac.

- Works very well! I really appreciate the slot to rest your thumb. Probably overkill for what I will use it for, but I enjoy it!

- Great mouse!!  Great resolution, smooth, very nice options.

- An excellent mouse.  It took a bit to get used to the back button being below where my thumb was normally placed but I m happy.

- Best mouse I ve ever used. No need for AA/AAA batteries as this mouse recharges via USB. The change lasts a very long time (at least several weeks of daily work and personal use). I have no regrets spending $100 on a mouse. I also like the tactile feel of the mouse buttons and the lack of the traditional clicking noise of button presses.

- Overall it is a great mouse. Sometimes I have connection and lagging issues but not too bad.

- Awesome mouse.  Very ergonomic and aesthetically pleasing.  It is very comfortable to use

- I’ve been uaing the mouse for quite a while and I have to say i love it. Some people talked about the weight in reviews saying its a bit heavy but it isn’t. Its perfect.

- I recently purchased the Logitech MX master 3S mouse and it has been an absolute experience. The wireless laser mouse is incredibly accurate and responsive, while the ultrafast scrolling feature makes navigating through websites a breeze. I m also a huge fan of its ergonomic design, which fits nicely in my hand. The Logitech MX Mouse is definitely worth every penny!

- Very comfortable on hands, provides a comfy grip.  I love it! I heard lots of good reviews about it & so I decided to buy one for myself.

- Good product I used one before similar to this. I would recommend this to anyone

- A great and simple mouse! Recommend it more for an office or hobbyist setting, as it lacks a bunch of extra buttons for gaming. That being said, the Logi Options+ Software lets you rebind most of the extra buttons, even the Horizontal Scroll Wheel. A good bit of extra flexibility goes a long way. The mouse is slightly heavier than most Logitech thanks to the built-in rechargeable battery via USB-C, but it is easy to get used to. The device comes with a Dongle for quick connection, but also has Bluetooth access. Up to 3 devices can be stored for quick switching. Additionally, the Logi Options+ can utilize Logi Flow to allow you to quickly change between multiple devices by simply dragging to a screen s edge, much like a Multiple Display setup.

- I can t find anything wrong with this mouse. It s very ergonomic, responsive, fast and I love the side wheel which I ve programmed for zoom function. The reason I wanted a laser, rather than optical, mouse is so that it will work on almost any surface, including my glass desk top.

- Everything about this mouse is fantastic, but it loses points to me because its full functionality is dependent on installing the Logi Options+ application. I use this mouse both on my work and personal computers and I can t install outside applications on my work computer so it isn t as good in that regard. Other than that, this mouse is outstanding

- This mouse has been the best mouse for productivity. Super smooth and thr click of the mouse is almost silent.

- This is my second MX mouse. Amazing and veey productive while switching between laptos. Also no need of that irritating usb dongle.

- Love the ergonomically and texture, smooth fast and reliable. Bast miles are you so far?

- This mouse was beyond disappointing for a price tag of 100$ and targeted at professionals. The scrolling was cheap and ruined the smooth-scrolling experience you get from the built-in trackpad. Specifically, inside Code editors, this mouse was scrolling way too fast, to a point where it was unusable. 15$ mouse does a better job than this. Though there were options provided in Logi + app, I needed help. Finally, I installed a third-party app to bring a smooth scrolling experience. I wish I could return this. If you are in the market for a mouse, you would be better off with other cheaper mice. Do not give in to the hype around this product! Period!

- I loved this mouse. I only went to the G604 because I got it on sale for a third of the price and it had most of the features I wanted. This mouse is incredible.

- This mouse is amazing! I was using the magic trackpad for years and switching to this i will never go back.

- Using the MX Master 3S does give the work experience a more premium feel than your average mouse. Bulkiness might not be for everyone.

- Easy to set up. Accurate. Long battery life. Quality materials.

- Great mouse. Really like the quiet click more than I thought I would. That is a great feature in an office environment. All of the customizations for the mouse are fantastic.

- Good mouse and worth of buying with ergonomics feature.

- Purchased this to pair with my Mac Mini since it didn’t come with a mouse. Love the ergonomic design. Not too big for my kids to use either.  Very responsive. Maybe too sensitive at times.

- Excellent.  I use it for gaming.  It fits my palm very well...

- Mouse is very high quality and precise. Good customization options and battery life before charging is excellent.

- Best mouse i have bought so far. Smooth and accurate

- Absolutely the best wireless mouse I ve ever owned.  The tactile feel is smooth and quiet.  I wonder how much more responsiveness is even possible!  The best wireless mouse going today.

- Great mouse to take to and from the office. Could not recommend more.

- Great mouse... handles up to 3 devices.  Very comfortable and responsive

- Outstanding device with exceptional long term quality.

- It s a great mouse! It works with Windows and Mac. I initially bought the MX Master 3S for the Mac butI exchanged it for this one. The only difference between the two is the color scheme and accessories. I preferred the dongle over the USB C cable.I have many cables. I use the dongle on my older Windows desktop and bluetooth on my MacBook. I have no issues with its usability. It has a feature called Flow where you can interchangeably use on the Mac and a Windows PC exchanging images and files back and forth while using both at the same time. Tracking and movement is nice as well. It s very customizable with the Logi software. It s perfect for my needs.

- I use it for gaming office and daily use. Its a good fit for all. But it is actually hugep

- Really good to use, wish it was a bit larger for my hands.

- Hands down the best mouse on the market. I have purchased over 20 of these for my office.. cant go wrong! I have all my desks paired with the Logitech K780 also the best KB on the market in my opinion!

- One mouse that you will cherish, and will do more than you expect a regular mouse to do. The extra set of buttons that can be customized, increase your efficiency.

- Works great switching between two laptops.  Have not had any issues with inteference as you would with basic wireless mouse.

- I loved the MX Master 2S and had to get the 3S. It didnt disappoint and it is incredibly quiet.

- I don t use it for gaming but for work.  I like the speed and how it fits my hand.

- I absolutely love this mouse. At $99 I was a little hesitant to buy it but it stays flawlessly connected via Bluetooth which was a big problem with outher mice that use dingles for me. Feels amazing in my hand with lots of buttons in perfect spots that are fully customizable and can even do different functions in different apps. Cannot recommend this product enough.

- Best mouse I ever used. Super quite, smooth and responsive to request. Makes working in large Excel and Visio files so much easier.

- Great mouse, very customizable and intuitive software.

- It is very expensive, but you are person who uses a mouse a lot it is worth it.

- This is the most expensive wireless mouse I have ever bought and 100% the BEST. I love the features this mouse has with the continuous free rolling scroller wheel along with the many features it has as well. The multiple buttons to use and simplicity of this mouse makes it the best. On top of all that; it’s the quietest mouse ever used with very minimal clicking noises. I definitely recommend it for anyone on the computer a lot or in my case using it for video and photography editing to speed up the process. I would definitely recommend this.

- This mouse is great. Very comfortable, and the new quiet buttons are great.

- This thing is awesome! I highly recommend it. This can be programmed to three separate devices.

- Great mouse eith good button location. Satisfied with this purchase

- Smooth. I like how the scroll wheel switches to smooth (rather then  notched ) scrolling automatically when it senses you are trying to scroll quickly. I dont really use the extra buttons but regardless the movement was worth the upgrade. I m sure I ll start taking advantage of horizontal wheel once I get used to it; it has not got in the way which is what I like.

- it is very easy to use. its tactile control is superb. it works seamlessly on any surface with great precision.

- Excellent for work flow management and programming buttons. Pretty decent quality

- Mouse is ok, but scroll wheel is not as convent as cheaper models and mouse has to be reset often.

- Logitech MX Master mice series is the best on the market and nothing comes close to competing or even coming close in terms of a productivity mouse. I have bought 3 already since I like them so much and want other people in my family to use them as well. It has truly changed we work. BUT PLEASE DO NOT buy the white version if you were like me and wanted a clean white set up. The mouse discolours so quickly and I have tried every cleaning option known to man and it does not come off the soft rubber shell. It looks disgusting and nothing can clean it but the problem is there is no mouse better so just buy a darker colour

- If you Google mx master 3 scrolling issue, you ll find this mouse (yes even the 3s) has issues detecting scrolling of you do it a certain way. Flicks of the wheel are fine. Slow rolls of the wheel are fine. But if you scroll too aggressively or jerky like me sometimes, this mouse fails to detect it while little every other mouse has no issues. As for clicking, at first it feels kind of mushy but you get used to it after a few hours and makes going back to loud mice unpleasant. Ergonomics are great, but the mouse is a little on the heavy side for my liking. Save money and get the m720. It has most of the features this has.

- Programming the buttons make it alot faster than the quick keys

- This mouse is incredible. I can’t imagine how one could possibly be more comfortable and easy to use

- Paired easily & works great with all personal devices. If using for work, make sure the software can be installed.

- Great mouse. Super customizable and great features

- Great usable and easy to setup mouse. Makes using the computer more comfortable

- Love the feel of this mouse. Ergonomically friendly

- Great rechargable mouse. The design and multiple functions make this work like a dream.

- I like the shape of the mouse which is comfortable. The only thing that I don’t like is the sensitivity on Chromebooks.

- TL;DR: Cursor will jump on Apple devices using the BOLT Nano Adapter Review:Logitech make some of the best accessories on the market.  I have been a user of their MX series line since it came out years ago. As someone that uses their devices in a more professional environment, my use case will see that these devices are used more often than others. When Logitech announced that they will be moving to the new BOLT nano adapter for MX mouse series, I wanted to upgrade our existing MX Master 3 mouse to this new one.That was a major mistake as the BOLT nano adapter is not 100% compatible with Apple s ridiculous requirements for external devices. If you plan to use this with an Apple device, common issues will be jumpy cursors, inconsistence scrolling and device time-outs. This has been well documented and acknowledged by Logitech and their Reddit support page. The device itself has a nice feel in the hand and as a Mac user, it offers enough creature comforts that using any other mouse sucks.With that said, I have also tried using the mouse as a standard BT directly connected to the Apple Mac Studio, it should work for a period of time but will time out due to new Apple security policies. Another limitation to Apple is that they don t allow non-Apple products to control the computer before logging in.  This is one of the reason you need to use the NANO adapter as it functions as a connection keyboard/mouse connection. Would I recommend this mouse, Yes.  But not for Apple users.  This mouse will work great with Windows and Linux computers.

- for anyone who uses editing programs or loves comfort.

- Great ergonomic and comfortable mouse for office work

- Purchased as a Christmas gift for my father & he loves it

- Works well, but I wish the device switching button was on top.

- Ergononic mouse, no issues. Best mouse for productivity.

- This is the first mouse I’ve gotten, after a lot of research I went for this I can say I am really happy so far, the latency is almost nonexistent, the quality is good, and if you are like me and don’t really like clicking sounds this version will be great. The setup process is really simple

- Smooth scrolling and movement, comfortable grip, and awesome lateral scrolling that makes navigating spreadsheets easy

- This is probably my favorite mouse right now. I have two others. It is smooth and very responsive. One of the better products I have purchased.

- Simply the best, look no further!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Second one of these purchased. Fits well in the hand.

- I WFH and invested in a mouse. This is hands down the best mouse I ever used. You will not regret it.

- Just upgraded to this mouse from a razer, mu productivty has increased by 30 percent

- This mouse exceeded my expecations. It feels very ergonmic and it doesnt make my wrist hurt despite using it all day like other have in the past. Highly recomend it.

- Excellent response, comfort and designed to pair with multiple computers. Replaced a track ball and reduced wrist strain.

- The ergonomic design is comfortable to use for long periods of time and the ultrafast scrolling feature has made navigating through documents and websites a breeze. The customization options are also a great bonus, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs. The USB-C, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity options make it easy to use with a variety of devices.First of all, the ergonomic design is top-notch. The shape of the mouse fits comfortably in my hand and the thumb rest and gesture button allow me to use the mouse without straining my hand or wrist. This is especially important for me as I tend to use a mouse for long periods of time and have experienced discomfort with other models in the past. The Logitech MX Master 3S has completely eliminated that issue for me.The ultrafast scrolling feature is also a game-changer. I frequently have to scroll through long documents and websites, and the smooth and precise scrolling on the MX Master 3S makes that task much easier and more efficient. It s a small detail, but it has made a big difference in my daily workflow.Overall, the Logitech MX Master 3S is a fantastic mouse that has greatly improved my productivity and comfort while using a computer. It s a high-quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone in need of a reliable and comfortable wireless mouse.

- Great mouse with very quiet clicks vs previous generations. There is definetely a bit of latency so I would not recommend this for gaming, but it s great for work and very comfortable. Do not get any colors other than black as the previous generation white mice discolored very quickly.Price is a bit steep so definetely try to get it on sale.

- The buttons are silent. Love the fact that you can completely personalize the buttons.

- Awesome mouse. Great macro buttons. Fits the hand well especially for a larger hand. Software is a bit intrusive and features lacking without it.

- This mouse does it all and I wish I purchased it earlier.

- Awesome. Works great on Mac or PC. Would recommend this product.

- This mouse is great for discovering new ways to optimize your workflow. Every button being remappable for the entire device and on a per app basis is very nice to allow for ease of navigation and usability of certain apps. My only complaints are in the shape and weight of the mouse alongside the polling rate. I notice that the mouse only polls at 125hz which sometimes feels jittery due to dropped packages. The weight is a bit heavier than I d like, and the shape misses some curves that could make the mouse fatiguing to use for a long duration for certain grip types. However these issues only apply tp those that use a lower DPI, and people that use a more typical high DPI will find no issues with this.

- Its great, quiet and smooth. At first it seemed big but I quickly got used to it.

- Mouse is ergnomically well designed but few operations especially gesture controls difficult to use. Pricy

- If you suffer from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, this is the best choice for you! Incredibly comfortable and minimices any tight feeling on the wrist. This is a 10+ hrs daily use mouse. The BT and 3 Different Device usage option is pure gravy.

- Excellent form fitting design. From the moment you hold it in your hands you can feel the fit & finish. You get what you pay for.

- Expensive and not good. It doesn t work nicely. It has a delay.

- Great functionality, feels well in the hand. No complaints.

- Best mouse rhat I didnt know I needed. Major help to my wrist compared to what I used to have.

- Very nice mouse, really enjoy using it, only thing I would change is make it a bit smaller.

- With _one_ design flaw, this is the best mouse I have owned.The form and functionality of the mouse are exceptional. It is ergonomically sculpted for use with a large, right hand. The scroll wheel is amazing and effortlessly zips through large amounts of vertically oriented information. Buttons are well placed (i.e., out of the way but easily enabled).My only complaint is that the wireless dongle is USB A. My new laptop has only USB C ports and the dongle requires a C to A USB adapter. I wound up using Bluetooth for a dongle-free connection. This required that I keep Bluetooth active when in sleep mode. Otherwise, the mouse had to be reacquired every time the laptop woke up.@Logitech, please design a USB C wireless dongle and include a USB C charging cable for this mouse.

- Super comfortable to use and very responsive.  I love it.

- We bought this mouse for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  She really likes all the features with it.

- Brilliant! Spectacular! Future proof! Smooth! Comfortable!

- Aesthetically functional and easy the maneuver the rolling toggles

- Very accurate,  feels good on your wrist stayed charged for a long time.

- Best mouse ever...possibly.  The S version will allow you to switch between PC and Mac, with the Mac using Bluetooth and the PC dongle.  Love the scrolling wheels, and back/forward buttons below the side scroller.

- This is hands-down the best mouse I ve ever owned. Horizontal scrolling, silent click, all the buttons, notched/endless vertical scrolling,

- This is the best mouse I’ve ever used. Wish I was able to use the app (can’t due to using on work computer)

- This was a gift for my wife and it worked out to be pefrct for her

- I was a bit hesitant at first but after buying and using this mouse for a while, I can say that it s a good value for money.

- Great precision and works well on multiple devices.

- The grip is super comfortable and ergonomic, it is easily my favorite mouse

- Terrific mouse.  Comfortable, high quality and adaptable.  Logitech software easy to install and use.

- mouse is comfortable and ergnomically awesome.  the scroll wheel has some kind of inertia built in to it, so that if you spin the wheel hard enough, it ll keep scrolling and slow down gradually. very nice!

- Easy setup, good quality & one of the best mouse in the market.

- Great mouse, extremely comfortable to use. Scrolling is super smooth. Lots of customization options with the logi Options+ suite.

- Great for hand relaxation and ergonomically comfortable.

- Battery lasts a while. Comfortable on the hand. Highly recommend

- I like the buttons are fully customizable. Works on any surface. Great size for my hands (medium size ).

- Ergonomic. USB -C good battery life. Better than the cheap one I had provided to me at work. No fatigue from a day of office work! The scroll wheel I pretty sweet for infinite scrolling

- The right mouse button didn t work real well. Also has limited programmability. I expect more for the money.

- This thing is amazing. 100% buy it. Never thought i needed horizontal scroll and button customizations on my mouse before, but now can’t live without it. Huge increase to productivity specifically for work.

- Logitech makes some of the best mice out there and this one did not disappoint. Very ergonomic and tacking is superb.

- Best mouse in the market Would recommend to anyone

- This is an all around great mouse. Highly recommended.

- Logi is always great.  Works like a dream.  Floats and quiet clicks.  Never misses a beat.  Love my mouse!

- This mouse is amazing, i needed a mouse that was egomaniac and didn t hurt my hand due to long used

- MX Master is one of the best mouse that you can get for yourself as a work setup

- Good mouse a bit jerky and the scroll is too fast at first but with the help of the logitech app you download to support the mouses functions it becomes easier to deal with.

- This mouse has the latest greatest features operating between 3 devices is amazing. Wish they had the one-touch search only missing feature;

- Good features and build quality. Something about the design hurt my hand/wrist/arm, so I returned it.

- I love almost everything about this mouse. Tracking awesome, customizable buttons, multi point Bluetooth, usb-c and side scroll (main reason I wanted this mouse). All great, just a little taller than I m used to. Sometimes when moving from keyboard back to mouse my hand hits the top of the mouse and pushes it away, not a huge concern but takes some getting used to. That s my only complaint, if you re stepping up from a cheap Logitech keyboard and mouse bundle it takes a couple weeks to get used to.

- This mouse lives up to the expectations. Solidly built, easy to setup (windows computer). Multi functionality. I’m a logitech fan for a reason. They never let me down!

- My favorite mouse to date.  Very comfortable and easy to setup.

- Comfortable in the hand and does exactly what I need with some extras.

- greatest mouse I ve. easy to set up . easy on the hand . fast and easy to use

- Excellent product. Great ergonomics (though not as good as MX Vertical). Buttons and controls are well tuned, great customization using the Logi Options+ app. Bit pricey. Very happy overall

- This mouse is actually worth the higher price. The claims that it improves productivity are accurate and I believe that is due to how customizable it is.

- This mouse is silent and fits my large hand perfectly.

- Very responsive and versatile.  I like the feel of the movement.

- I already had an MX Master 3 mouse when I bought this. I wanted to be able to keep one in my bag and leave the other on my desk so that I wouldn t forget it when I left. The  S  (Silent) version of this is a much bigger upgrade than I d expected. The 3 is great. The 3S is fanatstic.

- This mouse is great.  Silent buttons that are fully customizable and the scroll wheel on the side feel great.  The infinite scrolling option is also really nice.  I love that I can have it connected to multiple devices and can switch it with the push of small button on the bottom.  Build quality feels good - it s fairly large with substantial weight.  Wouldn t be great for gaming due to weight but thats not who it s marketed to.  Definitely worth the money and far better than other options in this price range.

- Excellent response and smooth action. Easy set up with plenty of features. Solved my lag problem.

- Love the silent clicks on this version! And definitely the best scroll wheels on the market

- Love this mouse. Photoshop and lightroom made easy

- Love the extra functionality built for the Mac, but it does seem a but laggy sometimes

- I love this mouse! Very ergonomic and feels great! Inhave paired it with the logitech mx mini and its the best combo!

- Has the best feel out of any Logitech mouse I ve ever purchased, which has been quite a few.  Good ergonomics and feels high quality.

- This mouse has a lot of great features. I do a lot of text editing and it is very useful to have keybinds on the mouse for different applications. However I’ve found the keybinds inevitably are forgotten by my computer’s OS, or get mixed up. A system reset usually fixes the problem, but it happens at least one or two times a week. This shouldn’t be an issue on a product this expensive.

- I love this mouse!  That s it!  I love it!!!  Recommended!

- What more do i need to say? Its a good, comfy, versitile mouse

- The mouse works so well. Don’t even need a mouse pad and it works well on glass too

- Great mouse! Good weigh. (I like heavy) quite click. It is a touch shorter than my original MX master, that I don’t like.

- Love this mouse, and I have never really cared about the mouse I would use until now. The programable buttons and the thumb wheel are great and useful. The scroll wheel can be switched between a click feel and free spinning and it makes scrolling up and down so much easier. It is a very quiet mouse when pushing down on the buttons, practically silent. The new dongle connects to both mouse and keyboard so that s a plus.

- Loved the ergonomics of this mouse. High DPI, free spin scroll, plenty of buttons and horizontal scroll wheel. Great build quality. Unfortunately I couldn t use this mouse because of interference of the other wireless items at my desk. For that I m knocking off a star since the Razer mouse it s replacing worked fine until a button wore out. Also, if you have small hands this mouse might be a little big for you.

- Best mouse I ve ever used! I had the previous version of it and this one is way better!

- I love this mouse more than I thought I would. It feels fantastic in the hands and once you download the LogiOptions+ you can customize the buttons and gestures to ahything you want. I love that it can be programmed to multiple devices so I move it between my work machine and personal MacBook. I didnt even relaize that theres an extra button where the thumb rests until just yesterday and it s game changing.

- This mouse is amazing! The silent clicks are so sarisfying. Works great with multiple devices. If you need a great mouse for productivity, this is it!!

- Amazing ergonomic mouse that makes a full day of desk work more pleasurable.

- This mouse is great. Works well with my computer. Just a really nice feeling and is great quality. Definitely more expensive for a day to day mouse, but if you are lookinh for a quality wireless mouse, get this.

- Excellent mouse, zero noise. Very comfortable. Love it

- The response on the mouse is very good. Once you download the logitech app and setup the mouse, lots of the settings can be adjusted. Easy to use and simple setup.

- I absolutely love this mouse. It glides across my screen

- Mouse that is easy to use, ergonomically sound, communicates well with my computer

- A little expensive but if you spend more than 4 hours a day in front of a computer, it s worth the investment. Excellent for CAD modelling but not a good gaming mouse.

- Pointer was very laggy for me. Never had an issue with a wireless device prior to this one. Returned.

- This is by far the best productive mouse I ve had with even quieter click sound

- As a mac and window user, this mouse is great. I really like that it is very quiet but tactile clicking. Also, it is heavier that a regular mouse which I prefer. The magnetic scroll wheel is great for speed browsing.

- Its really great for the price and helps ease the pain of long work hours on fingers

- Built well. Replaces same mouse that lasted 4 years and 10’a of 1,000,000’s of clicks.

- So many customization options. No lag. Super comfortable on the hand.

- Love the soft buttons. Super responsive and precise. Easy setup on Mac.

- This items has unique posture to working with using your computer

- I bought this for my wife since i use one at work and she loves it. Super comfortable and being able to switch between devices is amazing!

- Very smooth mouse, most comfortable option I ve had probably ever -- I have some carpal tunnel pain and this mouse has definitely improved feeling while using my computer at my desk job.  Expensive on the front end, but definitely worth it.  I take this mouse home with me on extended weekends to use at my home desktop.

- This is a great mouse. I upgraded from MX Master 2.

- Really good build quality love the scroll wheel the metal and magnet mechanism for the clicking and also smooth simulation is like nothing else

- Fits well in my hand. Scroll is awesome even has two modes. Perfect for work. Convenient Bluetooth and usb connection

- Quiet, fast, connects perfectly. Everything I expect from Logitech and more.

- Great product, easy to use! Much more comfortable than I imagined

- Unfortunately the MX3 was discontinued and the 3s replaced it. The difference is that the 3s does not have a click sound to it. It s actual silent. Not my cup of tea but the mouse performs just as the other Master mouses did.

- Super quiet if working in hotel rooms and not wanting to wake your lived one with the clicking sounds of the usual mouse and side scrolling excellent for spreadsheets.

- OK, if it s so awesome, why not 5 stars? I partly blame Best Buy, buy mostly Logi. This mouse was on the same display cap as the rest of the Logi MX devices, but be aware, it uses a different dongle than the rest. The MX Keys that I have use the Logi Unifying Receiver dongle, and this MX Master 3S mouse uses the Logi Bolt dongle. They are NOT compatible, and thus you will have to use both dongles in your PC/Mac. The alternative is to pair both devices with Bluetooth which I will do and revise my review.On to the rest...The movement and scroll are really smooth. Significantly better that my old M705, which at the time, was the best Logi made. All of the buttons and wheel functions are programmable when you install the Logi Options+ App. Logi has also updated the charging port to USB C, which is the same as my MX Keys port.It takes a little getting used to, but the side to side scroll is controlled by the wheel on the side, above your thumb and it is so smooth.All in all, this mouse is a significant upgrade to my M705.I totally recommend it.

- I loved the MX Master 3, but the 3S is just about perfect.  As others have said, this is just an improvement on top of an already great mouse, and at the same price point.  My only issue is I wish the device selection button wasn t on the bottom.

- Great product. Highly recommend. Price is decent as well.

- I ve only purchased this item 3 weeks ago, and already they want me to  review  this thing! What can I say? It s just a friggin  mouse. It s not like it can do anything other than what it s made for. My only problem is that I can t configure it because STUPID Microsoft wants us to keep our PC in  S Mode , making it impossible to download the app for this mouse!! Sure, I can take it out of S Mode, but do I really want my PC susceptible to viruses or malware just to have the option to configure this mouse? With my luck, my computer will blow up the second I take it out of S Mode! Also, the only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is because I NEVER give a product a perfect score!! There s no such thing as a perfect product!! So, there! I ll just let the geeks, nerds, and dorks fight it out amongst themselves regarding stupid ratings!!

- Work from home, this was exactly what I needed. Worth the investment.

- A really good mouse to use in the bed desk really anywhere. The Bluetooth switch is godsend!

- This mouse is a great additional to anyones work from home setup.  I use this with my work computer, personal computer, and iPad Pro.

- Works as advertised. Easy to install. Excellent store assistance.

- I love this version. Glad I lost the version one to make me upgrade

- Wireless receiver broke within a week of purchasing, For a $100 mouse you think it would be a little more robust, I ended up just returning it and saving the money. Beyond that the gesture button really isnt that use full, and using the horizontal scroll wheel is weird since it feels nothing like the regular scroll wheel.

- Love this mouse for both gaming and productivity! the wireless feature can allow you to connect to 3 different devices.

- A massive upgrade even over the fairly recent MX Master 3. The quite-ness of the clicks alone make this so much more usable than the Master 3. Never knew this is what I was missing until I bought it.

- A must have item for anyone using a mouse for long periods of time. I had the Master MX 3 and upgraded to this one for the silent clicks. Perfect for an office setting. Many customizable settings, great for developers and scrolling websites. Worth the price!

- Great Buy. Comfortable and long lasting battery. I have no issues with it.

- This mouse is great…except when it randomly disconnects from my MacBook Pro.

- The clicks on rhis mouse are the most satisfying. Hand rest position while using is amazing!

- It’s Logitech.efforless connection. It feels good on your hand and the battery do last forever. It works on any surface too

- I have owned a few renditions of the mx master mouses. The click is a lot quieter than the mx master 3, and i didnt appreciate that until i owned this one, but it shouldnt be a big impact on deciding between the 3 and 3s. The one quark ive noticed is when you scroll veritcal and then horizontal immediately, you need to pause a second, or it will continie to scroll in  the direction you first started. The reciever is also updated now and it doesnt connect to the orange logo unifying receivers.

- This mouse feels fantastic, I have bigger hands and wish it was slightly wider, but have since adopted a new hand positioning with three fingers on top of the mouse and pinky on the side as opposed to my standard two fingers on top and two on the side.

- Very nice and comfortable to use all day at work. The fast scroll feature is very useful.

- love the way this feels while in use and love how smother if feels

- This is the best mouse I have purchased all time. It is charged by USB and I have not had to charge it since I purchased it. I do turn it off after daily use averaging at least 8 hours of use a day. I have big hands the mouse fits comfortable. It has a quick reaction time for scrolling and clicking buttons. The product is pricey but so far worth it.

- Its the luxury model. I dont know that can go back to a common mouse.

- This is a great mouse for you desktop! Little big for a mobile use.

- It s a great lil device. Multi-device connectivity is key.

- This mouse is great! I purchased this mouse alongside the Mx mechanical keyboard and it has been the best combination I have ever used. I can use this mouse all day at my desk and I have no issues whatsoever. In my opinion, it is comfortable, reliable, and overall a great piece to have for your desk setup.

- The best Logitech product I ve owned. Which admittedly isn t a high bar. The freescroll wheel makes it hard to go to a stiff, clicky, normal one.Being able to re-assign the middle  freescroll  button to something else shows that the engineers designing it actually use this thing. I had two of the MX Master 1 but Im going on 3 years with this one and it still feels premium. I figured with my history that the Scroll would get messed up and start being janky, Thankfully I was wrong. One of the few times a premium item from Logitech is worth the recommendation. Higher DPI would be nice but doesn t really affect my usage of it. It has really just disappeared into my desk and usage, and only calls attention to itself when I have to use other  lesser  mice, Which is exactly what you want from any peripheral.

- Very comfortable, fast and accurate.Not for gaming but good for everything else.

- Super responsive and zero lag…love the scroll and love the feel in your hand.  Great product

- I mean it s really a great mouse, don t regret the price at all. Quiet, long battery life, and comfortable!

- Great mouse like the size and shape. needs to be cheaper in price

- This mouse is great, and is a joy to use, it was delivered on the same day.Thank you BestBuy

- This is the absolute best mouse I have ever owned, it has the best features. I love the smoothness and the glide across any surface I also love the scroll feature that allows the scroll wheel to spin and quickly scroll an entire page in no time.

- A long overdue upgrade from a previous MX, feels great and have an awesome precision, an worthy upgrade!

- I have been using the MX Master since Gen 1 and they have come a long way. The MX Master 3S is perfect. It s a lot quieter with its clicks (which is if you want loud clicks pick up a regular master 3 or another other MX Master. Solid mouse with great customization software.

- This mouse is the best I ve ever had.  I immediately had a   where have you been all my life  moment upon first use.The shape is good.  I have big hands and the body is allows for various hand positions.  It would be good for a small handed person, too.  Maybe even better.  The scroll wheel is unlike anything I ve used before.  There is a  brake  on it, and when engaged, it has those small clicks like a normal mouse scroll wheel.  You d want to use that for scrolling down a web page, for example.  Whenever you want a lot of control.  But the best part is if you spin that scroll wheel hard, or disengage the brake, it will just spin...for a very long time.  You could scroll down 1000 pages with one flick of your finger.  No joke.  The scroll wheel must have a little weight to it because it will spin forever.  If you find yourself scrolling large distances in large documents or code, you will love this mouse.Battery life is outstanding.  There s no RGB but that s okay.  Best.  Mouse.  Evar.

- I love it, I can connect to 3 devices via Bluetooth and switch between devices by clicking a button..very good battery life.

- Great mouse very smooth and productive design.  Battery last pretty long. Even comes with a usb c sharing cable.

- What a wonderful mouse. I was experiencing hand issues so I decided to get this form fitting mouse. It s so smooth to use plus my hands comfortably grip it. I m satisfied with this purchase. I love the additional features like scrolling to another tab or the ability to preset.

- DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU PLAN TO USE FOR WORK COMPUTER. Logitech is dumb to release this when the app you have to install to use functions will not install if you try to install in work computer. Your IT department cannot install this for you. Its been few months they know this is issue but still wont fix the problem. Again, DO NOT GET THIS FOR WORK

- Excellent devise, made for a smaller hand.  Easy setup.

- Far better than the mx master 3- the clicks feel more solid and sturdy

- excellent so far, quite and comfortable，easy to connect

- Have had this mouse for 1 day after the return policy (2 weeks)-dropped 1 time off couch onto carpeted floor. Clicks and scroll wheel now make noise, no longer a  silent  mouse. Very disappointed in this mouse for the price point. Would not buy again.

- Very very comfortable for the hands. Naturally fitting

- Great quality. Proxy for a mouse but needed the side scroll wheel. Quiet click really is quiet.

- This mouse is a huge upgrade to the MX Master (old version) - it is super quiet, scrolls very fast, and is very responsive on a lot of different surfaces. It lives up the Logitech name.

- Extremely smooth. Excellent quality. Feels great to use. The wife said it is a little large for her hands, but that is not enough to bring the score down.

- Best mouse known to man.. the scroll wheel does slightly wobble if u shake it well.. it’s not a defect sadly. Other than that which isn’t noticeable it’s amazing. So much capabilities.

- Amazing mouse, super quiet, super fast, helps get the job done

- I was pretty hesitant to spend $100 on a mouse, but it s worth it. I work in databases, spreadsheets and IDE s all day and the smooth scroll, side scroll and extra buttons are now must haves for me.

- Logitech makes great mice, I love the MX series mice

- Been rocking these since the first edition.  Love them and will only use these one all work and home set ups.

- Mouse is very smooth and you can customize all buttons & gestures. Highly recommend for any creator or light gamer.

- I bought this because my hand would start hurting from using a non ergonomic mouse all day.  I lost my first one after two years because I take it everywhere.  Went to the store and immediately bought my second one.  If you use a computer all day one of the best investments you can make.  Comfort and productivity went way up.

- I love this mouse this is my first MX mouse from Logitech it has all the functionality I m looking for.

- pairs great with MX keys.  really smooth.  took a few days to get comfortable, since its larger than the old mouse.

- Without a doubt a must for the photo editor. The mouse works great with everything but it can’t be beat for the ease of use with Lightroom.

- good mouse. use it every day for work. recommended. only drawback is its little bit expensive.

- I own both the MX Master 3 and the 3S. They are virtually identical with some minor differences in coloring.  The biggest, noticeable improvement is that the 3S has significantly quieter left and right click buttons.  I believe there have been improvements to the sensor as well but for standard, everyday use, it s not something that stands out. Overall, the mouse and software are phenomenal and easily configured. Physically, it s very comfortable to use for long periods of time. I tried out Logitech s ergonomic mouse as well for comparison but the upright configuration is actually less comfortable to use.  I d highly recommend this 3S model (or the 3 is perfectly sufficient too).

- Great mouse that can customized for different apps or programs!

- The absolute best mouse I have ever used for pleasure & production!

- The touch and feel of this mouse is excellent.  The button actions and sounds are super quiet.  It has all the functions and buttons I need to navigate large spreadsheets with ease.  The  Flow  function is amazing...allowing me to use the mouse on two separate devices at the same time and it will automatically transfer as I move the mouse from screen to screen (ON SEPARATE COMPUTERS).

- I bought this mouse to replace a Logitech Ergo trackball. I d heard good things about it from graphic designers and, even though I write and don t do much design, I thought I d try it. I m still learning how to set it up and use it the best way for me, but so far it s great.

- Feel good in your and when using , sweet respond, easy to set up,

- This helps the pressure on my wrist. Easy to set up. I use it with my MacBook Pro

- Just what I needed  - comfortable to use and easy to adapt to .

- One of the best things period I have gotten in a long time. Works great! Feels great! The ability to switch to another machine is very handy!

- The mouse is great. Its a good size for larger hands. The setup was super easy.

- Everything about this mouse is amazing. Feels great in your hand. Love the thumb rest. Works great on my desktop without a mouse pad.

- I currently own the original MX Master and I love it so much that I bought this for my wife to replace another MX mouse. Easy to use and great quality. I highly recommend it!

- Loved this mouse when I first got it. Silent buttons feel great and the overall shape of the mouse is perfect. After a month of use, the rubberized coating on the mouse has picked up some dirt and dis-coloured significantly. I can t imagine how this mouse will look in a few more months. Nothing I have tried cleans the dis-colouration.I do NOT recommend buying this mouse until Logitech fixes the formulation/composition of the rubberized coating on this mouse or removes it altogether.

- I m a design I draw using autoCAD every day.  I purchased the MX Master Wireless Laser Mouse 10/9/2015 it lasted almost 7 years, loved it. No issues with it so I recently purchased MX Master 3S Wireless Laser Mouse, the new model is better then the old, the grip is slight improved, the functions are a bit crisper and the right click is quieter.  I d buy another one.

- Had an MX Anywhere 3s and wanted to try this one.  It did not disappoint.  It is very sharp and accurate and very much alleviates the pains in my hands when holding a mouse.

- Great great productivity Mouse, BUT stay away from the white colour option, it get stained easily and I had to return it for the Black/grey option.

- Best mouse ever. Some might not like the feel of the click since it’s not like your traditional mouse, but I’m very happy with it overall.

- Never used an  upgraded  mouse before.  Just stuck with the plain old Logitech mice before.  It s a world of a difference.

- Amazing mouse especially when paired with the logitech keyboard for mac. Very ergonomic design, and a major productivity booster.

- Best mouse yet for very smooth usage and pairing is simple.

- It’s been great to use.  I love the horizontal scrolling for spreadsheets and it seems quite fluid in motion compared to others.  It’s very comfortable to use.  It paired to both my Mac and my pc immediately.  The only drawback is that it is bulky to carry around.  I’m afraid it’s going to get broken in my bag as I take it from work to home daily.

- This mouse is quiet.  Upgraded from master 3 and i love it.

- Best mouse I have used in a while.  I normally hate using a mice, but this mouse is responsive and allows you to quickly navigate through windows and web pages.  In addition it doesn’t require a using dongle it’s Bluetooth and its rechargeable.

- Love, Love, Love this mouse. It is so light and has a great click to it. I m using it with my MacBook Air and there isn t a delay at all. My husband even tried it and was surprised at the lightness of the mouse and the smoothness of the clicking of buttons.

- Beautifully built and with terrific battery life. Very responsive and accurate.

- Great mouse. For photo editing and vide editing it is great. Smooth and reliable. I have it connected to a macbook air as well as my ipad and it is easy to transition between both. Customizable buttons within individual apps make this mouse extraordinarily versatile and I don t think I can go back to anything else!

- Everyone always ask me am I working because they never hear a CLICK.  This is the best MUSE I have ever trapped.

- I bought this mouse because I have had a broken wrist and I’m at my computer for multiple hours at a time.  This makes a huge difference.  I no longer have joint pain while working or after.

- Easy connect, fluid movement, comfortable. Multi computer connect

- This mouse is the best I have every used.  Seamless set-up.  Ergonomic fit.

- Mouse performs per Logitech s write-up.  Easy to install, long battery life, and very quiet.

- Clicking feels better than the MX Master 3. It s not worth the upgrade though unless you truly need a silent click.

- Definitely like the ability to connect to multiple computers.  Rechargeable battery is nice too.  Good precision of movement.

- Excellent mouse with great feature set. Would recommend highly.

- I tried several mice from Logitech before landing on this one. Ultimately, the Logi Bolt connection and gestures feature are what sold me. I can quickly access file folders by reassigning the buttons and even change the smoothness of my pointer. The feel of the unit is very ergonomic and comfortable. I’m actually shopping for another right now.

- Love this mouse, great ergonomics and fits good in my hand. Lots of buttons to customize. I use the Adobe Creative suite and it is perfect.

- Best mouse- take advantage of the customizable buttons, I use copy/paste and screenshot very often. Soft click is great for being in the office

- Great ergonomics and the customizable buttons for specific apps is a very useful feature. Was previously using a Magic Mouse but my hand would cramp after long periods of editing. I love that I didn’t loose the ability to use the gestures such as Mission Control and switching between desktops. I am also enjoying the side scroll wheel.

- The mouse is comfortable, quiet and reliable! The ability to quickly switch between multiple sync d computers is very useful as well.

- I chose this mouse because my arthritic thumb felt best on it. I am not a gamer, but I appreciate how faster and smooth it is. It s been an excellent purchase.

- Overall, not bad. Scrolls nicely, very responsive, good size...

- just  the right size and comfortable to use. Easy to charge and charges quickly

- Absolutely the best traditional mouse available. The button/wheel layout and function is intuitive. This mouse has capabilities that create opportunities for increased productivity.

- Absolutely love this mouse from the minute I pulled it out of the box! Its comfortable, quiet and works great!! Love the bluetooth option.

- Best mouse on the market - With Mac to iPadOS universal control, you can control 4 devices with this mouse, not just three.

- First decent mouse and it is worth the upgrade over a basic one

- I really wanted to like this mouse, the form factor, buttons, software are all good.  I like that it is Bluetooth.  However, for me, with large hands using a mix of palm and fingertip grips, it just was uncomfortable.  Unfortunately I returned this.

- Great mouse, super quiet clicking. The updated version is a good improvement on a great mouse.

- There s a ton of reviews online about these so I won t be writing a novel about their pros and cons. But I will say, if you use an Apple Magic Mouse and work long hours, this is the way to go.

- Love this product. By far my favorite mouse. I especially love the ultrafast scrolling

- Great mouse.  Very smooth and easy to use.  Very easy set up.  The only disappointment is that the receiver is not the same receiver that my MX keyboard uses.  I have to use to two different receivers for the wireless keyboard and this mouse.  The buttons and the wheels are very smooth and quiet

- I haven’t used a mouse in a long time and when I last did it was nothing compared to this the comfort and accuracy all are top notch here and anybody who is anybody should use it .worth the price and its multiple uses.

- love the minimal click sound. better that the previous generation.

- Nice functions, fits the hand well, very smooth with the movement

- LIKE THIS ONE A LOT.  NO NEED FOR LITTLE PLUG-IN BECAUSE IT IS ALSO BLUETOOTH.  GREAT BECAUSE I AM ALWAYS MISPLACING IT.  SMOOTH AND VERY EASY TO HANDLE.

- Fantastic mouse. Has a few buttons on it that you can hotkey to do different things with the logi app such as scroll, zoom, copy/paste, etc. would buy again. Battery hasn’t died on me yet since purchase date.

- Works great! Very responsive! Love the Bluetooth connection over the dongle. Makes a hug e difference!

- 

- so smooth and quiet. Very glad that I waited and bought the 3s. The new switches are almost silent; especially when compared to the older 3 or 2s.

- I am so much more efficient with these mouses. You can completely customize. I have a  copy  and  paste  and so many other buttons you can customize to be extremely efficient.

- so far love the mouse easy to operate does every thing i need plus some !!!

- Love the size, feel and function of this mouse. Actually, there are some many possibilities with it you just have to dive in one at a time. Great scrolling. Full size feel. Vertical scrolling OR scrolling through open desktops. The battery life is beyond awesome.

- Absolutely love this mouse. Quick pairing via bluetooth and the new Logi bolt receiver has been very seamless. I use this device everyday, actively paired to a Windows machine, Mac M1 Pro and Linux machine. *Logi Options+ is not supported on Linux, but the mouse still functions as a standard mouse.No hiccups, and the scroll wheels are incredibly satisfying to use. Being able to create application profiles for each button s function has been a game changer!

- the perfect mouse...had a previous version that I loved and it died so I needed a replacement and was not sure if it would as good, but its better and I love it

- I use this mouse for music and video production/ I also use it for gaming, nothing competitive, but it works perfectly. I ll never stray away from the MX series

- Definitely is worth it!! It feels great and very easy to work on all Platforms,, very Music and gaming friendly

- It’s responsive and filled with programmable options.

- This thing works and feels better than I ever thought a mouse could be.

- Replaced my mouse at work, and now its hard to use another mouse!  fits like a glove 

- smooth operation, good features, nice fit for the right hand

- So far, so good. I really like it !!  I would give it 4 stars if it wasn t so pricy.  But still, I really really like it !! Best mouse I have had so far.

- As a former owner of the MX Master 2, it was a no brainer when I decided to upgrade to the MX Master 3S.  The added bonus was pairing this up to the new MX Mechanical Keyboard from Logitech.  Only consuming one USB port with the Logitech Bolt dongle, along with the flawless connection and long battery life per charge, left me with zero buyer s remorse.  Not the cheapest solution out there, but definitely the best.

- You don’t know how nice the quiet clicks are until you use a different mouse, loving this thing

- This is the only brand of mouse that I will buy. I currently have two of them. I have had probably five over the last couple of years. I usually upgrade when the new version comes out.

- The unit is easy to use and feels great in my hand.  There is a nice app that make a lot easy movements.  With all the buttons to use for everything you could possibly want it make it a no brainer

- Two small improvements over the Master S: the sensor has double the resolution and there are no  clicks  from using the mouse. Great ergonomics, long battery life, extremely customizable. Best mouse on the market for Mac or Windows.

- Great for everything, hyperscroll wheel is great for going through lots of files quickly, multiple buttons to try out and can format them based on what application you need them for. And good thumbrest placement making it feel comfortable. Also silent clicking is satisfying while working.

- I have been using some iteration of the MX for so many years I cannot even remember how long it has been. With each one, they get better. The changes are subtle with this newest version, but still nice improvements. The click is not  clicky  anymore, but rather silent. It was strange at first, but I am really liking it. There is also increased DPI control and parameters. Beyond that, a little bit of a different look and feel, both of which I like.It is still the same fantastic productivity mouse. Comfortable. Numerous buttons in all the right places. Scroll wheel speed control. Perhaps most importantly, the excellent Logi software that gives you complete control over the mouse, globally, and in specific programs. All in all, this is a great mouse.

- very smooth, very quiet, and the logitech app is very well set up

- If you are in need for a mouse that can support multiple devices than this is the one you need to buy. Also, if we love noiseless clicks on the mouse, I think this is the best in the market. I use it for 3 devices and works seemless. The battery backup is also great. I charge once every two weeks or so.

- While I do feel that this mouse is a little bit overrated, it is still quite a good mouse. Its greatness really has to do with with the software allowing gestures which really is on most newer logitech mouses. The one thing this mouse has is button on the side which honestly is really weird to reach and press. But still in general its still a really good mouse.

- Amazing for excel and jumping between work, school, and personal laptops

- Incredible upgrade from an MX2.  Much smoother and more precise on high def screens.  Totally silent click is very nice addition.

- It’s a bit pricey, but the mouse has been great! Very smooth. I love that it connects up to 3 systems!

- This is my second MX Master 3S and I am more than happy with its performance. Logitech seems to keep improving on their mice and keyboards. Just when you thought it could not get any better.

- I am enjoying this new Logitech Mouse so far.  It s like the older version but it now has the USB dongle.  I has some issues with the dongle a few times but overall seems to be working ok.  I m hoping there are some updates to make sure the connection is more reliable.

- The sexiest and most comfortable office mouse I ve used. Well worth the money and feels extremely premium.

- Definitely the best you can expect. It is super sharp and very comfortable.

- Pros:-The shape and ergonomics are good for me. -Magnetic scroll wheel is incredible.-Thumb wheel + thumb buttonCons:-The mouse tends to stutter and lag, with the cursor getting  stuck  for a few milliseconds. -Buttons feel like mush.-Connectivity issues with the LogiBolt receiver (may be why it s stuttering)-Logitech Options+ feels either limiting or a source of the stuttering.The stuttering is tolerable for office work or web browsing, but completely unusable for anything requiring precision.

- I have only had this mouse for a little less than a month. And it is a game changer with it’s programmable buttons.

- Best productivity mouse on the market. I was upgraded from MX 3 , not much changed . But prefer latest and greatest .

- I had the MX Anywhere 3 before this and I liked it, but this is way better and more comfortable, especially for productivity and long term use

- I love the Logitech MX Master Mouses. My only tiff is the placement of the hot keys under the side scroller. Not the best ergonomically. My MX Master 1 is still my favorite.

- Very smooth transition when moving the arrow.  LOVE that the thumb is on the mouse instead of the surface!  Lightweight and easy to move around.

- Great mouse for multiple workstations. The ability to auto switch between workstations is kind of mind blowing. Battery life is next to none. Haven’t had to charge the mouse a single time yet since I bought it (today is 7/12/2022) I use it all day for both work and gaming if that gives you an idea of how much use it gets

- I have only used the basic features so far, but the mouse works well and has a comfortable grip.

- I have alway loved the quality and usability of Logi peripherals. They also back their products up with a great warranty.

- I was using apple Magic mouse. I bought this one as an upgrade and really I feel like my hand is in a spa just for itself. So so comfortable. Just feeling sorry for myself using that mouse all those years instead of this one...

- Best feature is seamless connectivity with 3 different devices. Worked with both mac and windows. Easy to switch.

- Amazing silent clicks, good for productivity. Wish polling was better. I only got this because my dog tore up my old master 3, but imo its not worth the upgrade if you already have the regular 3.

- This is an amazing mouse, but keep in mind that since it is Bluetooth…there is still a decent amount of lag time sadly.

- Love this mouse! Super easy setup. Great ergonomics and responsiveness. Highly recommend.

- Very smooth and quiet compare to the previous generation. I would recommend this mouse to anyone.

- I’ve had it for a few weeks and I have zero complaints. Much smoother then the prior generations and definitely the best mouse in the series yet. I’ve owned every mx and have had connection issues every once in a while with them, but not with this one yet.  IMO it’s the Best mouse for video editing and productivity on the market.

- Replaced MX Master 2 when sensor malfunctioned (dust-related) and mouse quit reliably tracking on glass. The replacement MX3S is better with more adjustability via software and still fits my hand. If you have a small hand like my wife, this may not be your best choice. Tracking is excellent on glass and hard surfaces. Recharging is now done by USB-C and is quicker than the previous model. I have not had it long enough to know how long between charges, but after a week, it remained nearly fully charged according to the LED flashes when recharging. High quality and worth the money.

- I would say one of the best quality mice I have purchased. Like the sound when clicking. Very smooth. Very good product.

- It’s very quiet and I love it. The old one Was good but this is faster and better

- I like the mouse and it definitely does has a nice silenced click. However, personally I prefer the clickier so unless you need to be more quiet in an office setting or something of the sort, the sort of muted click is not for you.

- The amount of customizable buttons with the gestures is amazing. This will really change my work flow

- I ve been using this mouse at work and home for several days, and besides some minor issues with the scroll is a great mouse.

- This thing is absolutely terrible on Macs. I have an M1 Mac Mini, updated, the mouse/software are fully updated, and I have nothing but problems.This is a huge step back from the MX Master 2 I had prior in virtually every single way. The scrolling is atrocious, the mouse will suddenly bug out and skip all over the place, the tracking is terrible, the whole thing is a mess.I have tried using with/without the USB receiver and it s terrible both ways.After searching around various forums, I m finding that Mac users in particular are having problems. It boggles my mind that it has almost nothing but 5 stars here as I write this, this thing is a MASSIVE step back from both the original and the MX Master 2.You know those really cheap $10 mice with terrible unresponsive scroll wheels with terrible tracking? It feels like a prettier version of that.Avoid! The MX Master 2 is great, this is just Logitech searching for yet another reason to reinvent the mouse and change things for the sake of changing things because how often can they continue to sell us the same peripherals?

- Pros:Super fastSmooth movementsQuiet clicksCons:Left thumb button is a bit hard to click

- Great design, comfortable mice but lacks in Flow technology. While working with Flow and switched to different computer this mice doesn t work. Need to turn off and wait for few seconds and turn it on again. I was there were switching computer buttons on the top like M720.  For $100, without proper Flow and easy switch not worth it.

- I had this mouse for too short of a time, yet it’s my favorite mouse of all time. I made the mistake of returning this mouse for an Apple Magic Mouse thinking I’d prefer the “Apple” ecosystem experience and the multi-touch controls, but I was so wrong and have been living with the wrong mouse since. I’ll likely be buying another of these before the year ends and seling my Apple Mouse 2. Definitely buy if youre a multi-tasker and need/want multi device switching on the fly. Programability of the functions is nice as well. 10/10 great design. Oh, and it was comfortable too!

- Comfortable mouse with constant disconnection issues using the provided USB dongle. Bluetooth connection is much more reliable.

- I’ve been looking for a mouse to help scroll though spreadsheets and other documents. It’s lived up to the other reviews, it’s a great mouse and you won’t be disappointed.

- Good mouse but not worth the price tag for laptop with existing mouse

- Great mouse, works well.  Sensitivity button is placed well.

- I have only owned the original MX Master mouse, which finally stopped working recently and would no longer charge. This new version of the mouse was my replacement purchase for that, and it s an awesome update to the original model. It is very comfortable in the hand, and doesn t feel all that different from the original model. The original MX mouse also needed to be recharged every few days for me, which was often quite annoying. I have owned this new 3S mouse for a couple of weeks now and the original charge is still at 65% despite heavy use every day. So it doesn t appear that I will need to recharge this mouse very often at all. Another thing I really like about this new version is the nearly silent clicks. You literally can barely hear it when you click on the buttons, and it just seems flawlessly smooth in operation. Another nice upgrade is the increased 8K DPI resolution tracking. If you have a large 4K display connected, you can literally just zip the cursor from one corner of the screen to another super fast with this enabled. The scroll wheel is also far smoother to operate, and you can use hyper-scrolling. And yes, it literally can track on a glass surface. I m extremely pleased with this new 3S mouse!

string(9122) "Take this List of reviews: 

- Quiet, smooth, and convenient. The mouse is satisfying to hold and I haven’t found a surface it doesn’t accurately track on. The mouse clicks are silent and barely audible, and the technology in the scroll wheel makes long documents effortless.

- great mouse extremely comfortable and alot of great features

- Best mouse I have ever used in 30 years as a graphic designer!

- I previously had the MX Master 3 and it was awesome! I did however did not like the clicks on the mouse. The 3S is awesomer! lol. Its one of those things where you have to buy it and use it to understand how great it is and not just take my word for it. Words can t fully do it justice. I recommend it highly.

- Great quality and is well worth the price tag. Would buy another

- Excellent mouse, highly recommended if you’re on a computer for long hours!

- Great mouse. Lots of tactile feedback and smooth controls.

- Best mouse out there, gets even better than its predecessors.

- I bought this mouse in an instant when I saw it had quiet clicks for the primary and secondary buttons. I can confirm after a marathon of copy and pasting in spreadsheets that the clicks are acurate and very quiet...like it.

- Definitely not made for small hands, after a while my hand started cramping because the mouse is so big.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] An optical mouse is nothing new for any of us in 2022. Even wireless mice are probably considered old school by now. So, why is this the better option than what you already have?Ultimately, this does what every other mouse does, but just a little bit better. It comes with a few extra buttons (and wheel) which are very easy to customize with the downloadable software. In particular, I really appreciate the sun wheel that sits directly below your left some along with the included back/forward buttons. You can customize any of these buttons to whatever keystroke you’d prefer, but I find the default settings to be perfect for me. Assuming you are right handed, this may be the most comfortable mouse I’ve ever used.Tracking is fast and very precise, and while it is not marketed as a gaming mouse, it seems more than adequate for that application, as well. Compared to my wired “gaming mouse“, I really can’t discern a difference (although I am admittedly not a hard-core, third person shooter, kind of guy)…. Wireless performance is seamless, as would be expected. One of the nice features of this particular mouse is that it can be connected either via Bluetooth or using the wireless dongle connected to a open the USB port. I can’t discern any particular latency with either option. It does have a onboard memory that will remember multiple devices, so it is easy to switch use from your desktop to a laptop, for example.Wow this does have some nice bells and whistle‘s, ultimately what matters is whether or not it functions as you would expect.  As already stated, for me this mouse is a solid improvement over my prior pointing device, and just seems a bit more polished in every way. For something that we use for probably 75% (conservative estimate) of our computer interaction - which for many of us can be several hours a day - this is more than a worthwhile investment. Two thumbs up!

- First, this feels like a very nice mouse. It s got a little heft to it and the scrolling is very cool.That said, it didn t do anything for me from an ergonomic standpoint over any of my other mice. I have relatively small hands for a guy (probably average for a girl), and my middle finger gets overextended. After about 10 minutes of use I knew I couldn t keep this.Additionally, the Logitech software didn t recognize the mouse, so I couldn t customize any settings (despite using the included Logitech dongle and such). I m sure I could have gotten it working with updates or reinstalling drivers, or something, but it s kind of unfortunate it didn t just work out of the box.Overall, this is a very nice, premium feeling productivity mouse. If my hands were larger, I d probably keep it.

- Big fan, love this product would definitely recommend

- Much improved over the MX Master 2S I replaced it with!

- Love the reduced clicking sound. Ergonomic, love using it.

- Although I still prefer my MX Ergo Plus (Logi has not released a newer version in years!!!), this mouse, this mouse is very nice.  Since I bought it and wrote this review the battery level is at 65%, (about 2 weeks).  It was simple to set up and pair with multiple PC s.  I wish the button to switch PCs was in a different location (it is on the bottom), but it make sense.  I just don t like lifting and flipping the mouse, just to switch.

- I finally decided to give up the Magic Mouse and I’m never looking back.The MX Master 3S is amazing and setup was real straightforward. Horizontal scrolling and the silent click is a deal maker. Pairing was easy as well.

- My previous Logitech MX mouse was getting old. I purchased this new Logitech - MX 3S mouse and am very pleased with it. It feels more accurate, and the clicks are softer.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I ve been using this mouse at work and home for several days, and I really want to love it. To start with, there s a lot of good here. The tracking sensor is very accurate and works on every surface I ve tried, from a glass tabletop to a bedsheet that always gives other mice trouble when using my laptop in bed. It s got a variety of DPI settings from 200 to 8k that make working on high resolution displays or small surfaces a breeze. I m still figuring out all of the stuff a horizontal scoll wheel is useful for. I was surprised when I found it allows me to quickly zoom in and out or adjust the size of brush in photoshop, for example. The buttons and scroll wheels are near silent, which is interesting, but not particularly useful to me, so I can take it or leave it. As quiet as they are, they still have enough tactile feedback that it doesn t feel strange. In general, this mouse feels different to other mice I have, and I m not entirely sure why. I feel like it sits higher overall, but fits to my hand in much the same way. It s not really any more or less comfortable, just different.Battery life so far is great. I ve been using it for five days and haven t had to recharge it yet. The wireless mouse I normally use needs to be plugged in about every two or three days to charge with moderate use. Unfortunately, it s got a bit of a problem with the vertical scroll wheel. It s just not accurate. Sometimes I ll wheel down a  notch  and nothing happens, or I ll be scrolling down and it ll just stop for a moment before it starts registering again. It s noticeable when it happens, and it happens often enough to be annoying. Even the cheapest of basic mice don t tend to have this problem, so I really don t expect it to happen with a premium product like this. I tried the Logi Options+ software to see if there was a firmware update available, but it said the mouse was up to date. Hopefully a future update can fix it.All things considered, it s a great mouse in a lot of ways, and Logitech products are generally high quality, so I ll recommend it under the assumption that that mine just has a rare defect.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This mouse was very easy to get working with my laptop! I pulled it out of the box, turned it on, and my laptop immediately asked me if I wanted to connect to it using Bluetooth. I didn t have all of the functionality that the software provides, but it worked immediately as a standard mouse.The software allows you to customize the buttons on the mouse to have quick-click functionality for whatever environment you re using it in. I like scrolling through tabs with the thumbwheel, personally.The design of the mouse feels more ergonomically correct than most mice I ve used over the last 28 years, and it has a fantastic weight, giving it a solidity that they have often been lacking. The texture of the surface is pleasant, and it really looks and feels like they put a lot of thought into the aesthetics.The battery seems like it will last a long time, but the fact that the USB-C port is on the front of it will make using as a  wired  mouse while it s charging will not be a problem in the slightest.

- Wanted a mouse for my iPad. Tried two mouses prior to the mx by Logitech. Logitech out performed both of the previous products by far. The scrolling wheel actually works as advertised and the thumb wheel is absolutely a must have when editing video. Top notch product by a top notch company. Price tag wasn’t the greatest but you get what you pay for.

- As a Mac user I bought the previous Mx Master 3 mouse, 3 days before the release of the 3s. I didn t like the loud click of the 3 so got tempted to order the 3s. Instantly knew I prefer the 3s.The advantages are the silent click and higher Dpi sensor. The sensor is beneficial if you want to move across the screen with minimal wrist movement or if you have multiple monitors. At 8k dpi you ll be able to move across a 27  screen with almost no noticeable wrist movement.If you never used the MX Master mouse before, the magic are the custom programmable buttons in the Options software. I always used the magic trackpads from Apple but now use this mouse mainly.

- Hard to go back to any other mouse after using the scroll wheel!

- It s a tried and true design that s beloved by many productivity focused professionals. Personally, I don t see the need for the silent click; it s definitely less satisfying when clicking.Also, I find it irritating that they changed the dongle and made it incompatible with the previous generation models. Regardless, it s an excellent mouse for productivity. It s just not much of an upgrade vs. MX Master 3.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech MX Master 3S is One of the best sculpt mouses available in the market today. It is a very solid mouse with high quality thumb scroll wheel and it is very easy to spin around. The main scrollwheel has also been made quieter, and somehow even more fun to use. However; the scroll has been very smooth and super responsive. I adjusted the default scroll speed to high as I would like to scroll faster. One thing i have noticed is that the scroll wheel has not been super silent, especially during ratcheting mode. Ergonomically perfect, very comfortable to use and play with. The mouse works on pretty much all kinds of surfaces, can easily connect to 3 devices, and can connect by using bluetooth or a USB dongle. The one thing I haven’t figured out yet is, when installing the custom profiles so that the mouse switches behavior based on the application you are using. I wouldn’t think this mouse would possibly suit gamers. This is a great mouse for daily users, professionals.I have a MacBook for work and this works great with my Mac at my office. I would highly recommend this to anyone.

- Great mouse for the value. Comfortable and quiet! I’ve owned the MX master 1 and 2s. This is by far the best.

- Bought this as a gift for my grandson. He is thrilled with its performance. It’s a great value too

- Enjoy this mouse quick and very quiet easy to use  response is great

- Great Mouse - very smooth and a lot of functionality.

- This seems like a pretty good mouse. I don t really care for the sensitivity of the scroll wheel. I m constantly bumping it and finding myself zoomed way in, or way out.

- Def takes some getting used to, but it s amazing. Download the application when you use it to make sure you setup the way you need!

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I spend a ton of time at the computer screen - easily 12+ hours a day and always looking for ways to improve ergonomics. This mouse is as close to ideal as it gets. Amazingly precise sensor that is tracking at 8k DPI resolution and able to work on most surfaces, scroll wheel with ability to unlock it for  free wheeling  and scroll thru huge documents and customizable side wheel, side buttons and a thumb button! Side buttons can be programmed for a standard Forward/Back in browsers to Audio Mute/UnMute + Camera On/Off in teleconferencing applications. Thumb button combines with the mouse movement so you can decide what happens when you press it and then move up, down and side to side.Battery life is impressive - I ve used this mouse for a week of everyday work - had not have to charge it yet. Charging is done via the USB-C port and allows you to continue working.Software - mouse is configurable via Logitech Option Plus (not the older Logitech Options) and Options Plus is not compatible with the previous generation devices so you might need both until you upgrade all gear. Same goes for a receiver - it s a new kind (not a Unifying receiver anymore) so you may need both or just use this mouse in a Bluetooth connectivity mode.Overall - I m loving it, no wrist pain, super sensitive, comfortable and VERY quiet! No mouse click sound, but still have a great tactile feedback.

- I love the speed, being able to connect to 3 devices, but mainly the buttons on the mouse, you can barely hear them. Nicke click.

- Sleek, comfortable and very quiet clicking. Smooth mobility and very ergonomic

- Looks great works great.  I am a MacBook user for music production and the Magic Mouse is miserable compared to this.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you ve worked with any of the previous versions of this mouse, you know that they fit your hand like a glove--assuming you re right-handed at least. The 3S is no difference. It fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. The two main buttons and scroll wheel feel great. The horizontal scroll wheel and button on the left where your thumb rests are all within reach for the one finger. The largest upgrade from the previous version of this mouse has to be, hands down, the clicking noise - or lack thereof! The difference is night and day! This new mouse is so incredibly quiet when clicking the right and left buttons. It s advertised at 90% quieter, and I believe it! If you re in a quiet room, especially with a partner studying or something, the reduced clicking noise alone will save you from ugly looks from them.The tracking sensor on the 3S is rated at 8,000 DPI, which is double that of the pervious version. While I cannot say that I ve noticed any difference, twice the rated performance is cool to know. Not only does it provide even better, more precise tracking of movement, but it also helps performance over a wide variety of surfaces. I have a mixed material desk (wood and glass). While the mouse is always on a mouse pad, I have tried it on the clear glass surface and it worked just fine.Connect this mouse up to three devices via Bluetooth or the included USB dongle. The mouse does have a USB-C port for charging, so you can use your own cable or the included USB-A to -C cable.The software allows you to customize the various buttons on the mouse and enhance its capabilities on both Mac and Windows. The software also allows you to seamlessly switch between screens with Logitech Flow (a software feature). I ve used it on my desktop and laptop and works okay, I guess. It s just not how I work, but it s there if you really want to take advantage of it.If you already own the MX 3, I wouldn t say the upgrade is worth it. If you re coming from a 2S or earlier version, or are looking for an incredible mouse, then I would absolutely recommend the MX Master 3S.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech’s MX Master 3s mouse represents the pinnacle of the MX series mice.  It offers refinement in materials, buttons, noise, connectivity, and ergonomics that set it apart from its predecessors.  As a long time fan of the MX series this mouse tops the Master/Performance series by a good margin.First of all, I’ll lead with the fact that Logitech has gone a long way to making their packaging more environmentally friendly.  Practically all the packaging was made of cardboard that’s easily recyclable instead of the “I’m going to cut you” plastic of yesteryear.  I appreciate this movement, and it means I can recycle or keep the box.  The mouse itself feels even more durable and the materials in use feel like this mouse will last a good long while.  While it does not include a user serviceable battery, I can attest that my 10 year old Performance MX can hold enough charge to be useful to this day, so I’m not concerned about this mouse becoming e-waste.Now, a few things to know about this mouse: It’s a continuation of the original MX Performance mouse, but really it’s a reimagined MX Master 3.  The Master 3s adds a new 8K sensor, super quiet buttons and an even quieter scroll wheel without messing with the existing ergonomics and connectivity already associated with the MX Master 3.  If you have a Master 3, you may not want to upgrade, but if you’re an OG or Master 2 mouse user, this is a worthy upgrade for sure.  Included in the box is a Bolt receiver which can be used with the first channel, and the other two channels can use Bluetooth (or another receiver).  Finally a USB-C to USB-A cable is included for charging.Speaking of charging, Logitech claims 3 hours of use from a single minute of charging.  70 days is possible from a full charge.  While I can’t verify those claims, almost a week of use hasn’t dented the battery significantly.  USB-C charging means this guy is pretty universally chargeable.  One thing I noticed is that it didn’t seem to be able to operate as a wired mouse when plugged in (and no receivers or connections).If you’re new to the MX Series, what really sets these mice apart is the scroll wheel.  Designed to be able to flick through an Excel spreadsheet at lightning speed (Logitech claims 1000 lines per second), the free spinning scroll wheel was an experiment that really did catch on with those that adopted the performance MX.  Originally a click in on the scroll wheel would change between free scrolling and clicky, but the later Master mice swapped to an automatic trigger (although the button right behind the wheel swaps modes).  If you scroll with enough force, the clicky scrolling gives way to free scrolling.  The MagSpeed scroll wheel is unique and functional.  This, combined with the larger shape, and plethora of buttons is what made the MX Performance/Master mice popular amongst business/software professionals.With the MX Master a horizontal scroll wheel was added, and this eventually turned into a more prominent feature.  While some pros do use the horizontal scroll wheel to move about in their enormous excel spreadsheets, I love Logitech’s Options+ software.  Not only can I set the primary feature to be volume control, in which the horizontal scroll wheel s heavy weighted feel is quite natural at, but the software also installs profiles: for instance in chrome, I can simply swap tabs using the horizontal scroll wheel, or use it for zoom in a powerpoint presentation.Another big feature that’s unique to the MX series is the darkfield sensor.  While Logitech has dropped the marketing wording around it, it’s still quiet the achievement in laser technology.  The ability to track on glass is still not the most universal feature, and this mouse basically will track on any surface pretty accurately.  The big differentiator for the 3s is the quiet click buttons.  It delivers its promise.  While being nearly inaudible, the buttons still maintain a satisfying click feel. Logitech made sure every button had this feel, which is a nice touch.  The thumb base button also feels quite soft.  I was impressed that button included gestures for multi-tasking that map very naturally into Windows 10/11 and Mac OS.Speaking of, the Logitech MX Master 3s fits right in a Mac environment.  Logitech Options+ software works well on both Mac and Windows and enables things like Flow, which can transfer text, images, and even files between computers.  It even allows swapping between computers by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen.  Logitech has really done an amazing job nailing the software, as Flow is super slick.Overall the MX Master 3s is a refinement upon several refinements.  I’ve long been a fan of these mice, and despite what some may say, I’ve successfully played twitch shooters on these mice for years to great effect.  The ability to trace anywhere is one of my favorite features.  I’ve been a long time user of the smaller Anywhere MX series, but this full size MX feels more natural than any of the other full size MX mice I’ve used in the past (Performance MX, Master MX).  For productivity, it’s hard to imagine a better mouse.  Logitech continues to deliver the best mice in the industry.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The MX Master 3S is my new favorite mouse for work. It’s extremely comfortable to use, has solid performance over Bluetooth or Logi Bolt, the side scroll wheel has a lot of convenient uses, and the battery lasts long enough that I never have to worry about charging. For productivity focused work it feels like the peak.Getting into the box, you get the mouse, a charging cable, and a Logi Bolt receiver. It should be noted the Logi Bolt receiver is somewhat new and not compatible with older Logitech devices that used the Unifying receiver. Something to keep in mind if you are already using other Logitech devices with an existing receiver. I set the mouse up first using the Logi Bolt receiver and the mouse appears to be pre-paired to it out of the box, so there was nothing for me to do but plug it into an existing USB-A port. Running the setup through the Logi Options+ software I was able to make assignments on each button and set up application-specific profiles. It is unfortunate that the Logi Options+ software isn’t compatible with all of Logitech’s mice and keyboards; currently I still need to use the older Logitech Options for my K680 keyboard.I’ve been using the MX Master 3S for a couple of weeks now and have used it as my primary work mouse for about a week. I’ve used it interchangeably over Bluetooth and with the Logi Bolt receiver in a relatively crowded office environment and the performance has been flawless in both cases. I cannot really point to a difference in using the mouse with the Bolt receiver or over Bluetooth. I think I might notice a little bit less latency over Bolt, but the difference is almost imperceptible. The first thing I noticed was how comfortable it was. It feels like it’s perfectly sculpted for my hand and the soft-touch plastic helps a lot as well. The side scroll wheel feels well positioned and I don’t have to strain my hand to get to it. The main scroll wheel feels similar to the MX Anywhere 3 and transitions seamlessly from stepping scrolling to free-wheeling and it felt really easy to dial in exactly the speed I wanted for the email or document I was working on. The primary left and right click buttons are very quiet, but there’s a tactileness to them that never makes me question whether or not I’ve clicked. With the software installed, the mouse will automatically switch profiles for applications you have loaded, which I think might work well for some people, but for me it was a little jarring to have the side scroll wheel flipping between tabs on Chrome only to then be adjusting volume or changing cells somewhere else. Thankfully, this is easy to turn off. There is also a button on the thumb rest that opens up some gesture controls. I didn’t get much use out of the gesture controls myself, but they work well enough. The cursor tracks smoothly across a variety of surfaces, though I can’t say I noticed too much of a difference turning the 8K sensor mode on. The standard mode (which is what the previous MX Master 3 has) is probably what most would use I’d imagine.The battery life has been excellent for me. I’ve used it for several full days and not seen the percentage drop at all. It’s quoted at 70 days by Logitech and I’m inclined to believe that. It’s certainly long enough that charging is never really on my mind.Before the MX Master 3S I was using the MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. I like that mouse a lot and ergonomics are important to me, but I’m considering switching to the MX Master 3S full time now just for the sheer amount of productivity features it gets me.It’s no gaming mouse and if you’re a lefty you’re out of luck, but for work I haven’t used anything better.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Logitech MX Master 3S is a great Mouse that you can take anywhere and it will work with up to 3 different devices which is a welcome versatile feature.First thing I did after taking the Logitech MX Master 3S out of the box was charge it with the included USB C cord, and Logitech claims the battery will last up to 70 days which is more than enough lasting power for me, if I get a month or so I’ll be happy. Time will tell.The Logitech MX Master 3S comes with an included Logi Bolt Bluetooth receiver but I didn’t need to use it for any of my devices. I paired my Logitech MX Master 3S with my MacBook, a Windows Gaming Laptop and an iPad Pro and once paired switching and working with different devices back and forth was seamless.The Logitech MX Master 3S is fully customizable if using the Logi Options+ software which is available for PC and Mac.Scrolling is smooth and overall operation of the Logitech MX Master 3S is fantastic.The Logitech MX Master 3S is my go to Mouse for all my devices now.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve owned many logi mice over the years, and they tend to be my go to brand for work and school. I wanted this mouse for my work from home setup, in lieu of the wired one provided to me. As always out of the box it was an easy setup, you really can just plug in and go for basic features. Had no problems with my work laptop connecting once I put the provided USB into it. First thing I noticed was how incredibly quiet it was while right, or left clicking. The Quiet Click feature is literally silent, and I can say I’ve never experienced such a genuinely quiet mouse click. The next thing I noticed was the scroll wheel, which is advertised as Magspeed, and once again something I’ve never seen before. The way it smoothly, and quickly can spin in a full rotation off of one stroke of the finger is super impressive. There are plenty of customizable options literally at your fingertips which I feel a lot of people will appreciate. The design is sleek, and visually appealing. The cons for me was although Logitech advertises a track glass, 8K dpi sensor that will work on any surface, that wasn’t the case for me. I have a gaming mousepad that spans my entire desk, and it literally felt like a workout moving the mouse around, despite the previous one by logi I used had no issues. I don’t want to have to rearrange my setup, just to accommodate this mouse. Also, it wasn’t as comfortable in my hand, and after only 10 minutes of use I felt some discomfort. I’m not sure if it was from having to exert so much energy to move the mouse around, or the design, but I feel both. The thumb pad is a nice ergonomic feature, but it just was not as comfortable to me in hand and I cannot use this everyday, for 8 hours at work which was disappointing. Maybe this would be better for other people, with different ergonomic needs than I. Overall, I would recommend this to the right person, and right setup, but may not work for everyone.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech has long been known for quality PC mice and keyboards and the MX Master 3S does not disappoint. It balances style and comfort, looking great on the desk while comfortable in your hand. The Logitech MX Master 3S connects to the PC using either Bluetooth or a small USB device called the Logitech Bolt receiver. Most laptops will have Bluetooth and even many desktops and so that’s likely your preferred method of connecting.If using a PC that doesn’t support Bluetooth you can use the supplied Logitech Bolt USB receiver. Note that this is the traditional style USB-A and not the more recent USB-C. Arguably this is understandable as more devices still use the older style USB ports so it increases compatibility, especially with devices that do not support Bluetooth.Charging the mouse is done with the supplied USB-A to USB-C cable and it charges quickly. One nice feature is that the port on the mouse is on the front and so it can be used while the device is charging. Overall, if you’re looking for a great mouse for home, work or school, this is an excellent option that will not disappoint.

- The MX Mechanical keyboard uses Bolt so that forced an upgrade from my Master 3 to the 3S. It s an incremental improvement. I don t do precision mouse work so much of the improvement is lost on me. Still, much like the Master 3 it s a great mouse. You ll notice a bigger difference between the 2S and 3S, not least going from microUSB charging to USB-C. Being able to easily switch between multiple computers is useful for me and works very well. If you re looking to replace the cheap wired mouse that came with your computer the 3S is a no brainer.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After 3 years of heavy usage, I was able to upgrade from the Master 3 as my main mouse (which is now my travel mouse) to the Master 3s. Though the look of the mouse is practically identical to its predecessor, the mechanical upgrade does make a big difference. One of the biggest pain points from the Master 3 was how loud the clicking noise was. As a designer, I do click a lot and it was the most annoying thing to other people. When you re clicking away in an isolated room, it probably doesn t matter as much but if you re next to someone using the mouse as a designer - its pretty distracting. I didn t realize until a colleague commented on it. But with the Master 3s, I was blown away how quiet the clicking was. There s also more sensor sensitivity options for those with higher resolution screens, I usually set mine at 1800 DPI,you can set it up to 8k max.Same as its predecessor, you can easily switch between different devices and adjust the settings of the horizontal/vertical scrolls, and other buttons depending on the program you re using through the Logi options app. Which as a designer, I fully take advantage of programing zooming in/out for the scrolling, copy/paste buttons and much more. Maybe because the mouse is newer the side scroll has a little more friction when scrolling which I personally like more. The design of the mouse allows my full hand to rest comfortably on the entire mouse. This essentially ruins me when I try to use the traditional mouse that is less comfortable and makes me long for my logitech master 3s.The only downfall is the USB-A bolt receiver, as it is incompatible with the other logitech devices and I would have to use a USB-A to C converter. Waiting on logitech to finally give us the USB-c. But overall no connection issues with the receiver or through Bluetooth.Overall, logitech never fails to deliver.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great mouse.  I also have a MX Master 3 which is almost the same, and find it super comfortable in my hand.  Smooth and responsive on my Mac Mini, MacBook Air and Windows laptop, and I love the option for multiple devices (up to 3) via the USB dongle or bluetooth.  Simply flip it over and tap the button.  Super convenient since I have multiple computers connected to the same monitor and keyboard setup as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                       The side thumb roller wheel is great for panning large Excel files or CAD drawings.  Top roller wheel smooth as well.  Great battery life, and easy to connect to a charge cord and still use like an  old-time  wired mouse.                                                                                                                                                   Definitely recommend!

- It is crazy how quiet this mouse is.  Never realized how load normal mouse clicks are.  This is like a stealth mouse so quiet.  Love how fast it is and how it can go on any surface

- This is probably the best mouse that I have ever used. I use a mouse everyday and was starting to notice that my wrist was starting to hurt more than normal. I decided to purchase this because how how well it fit into my hand. After using it a couple of days now, I can feel a difference from using a mouse that caused me pain to a mouse that I can’t stop using!

- Great product highly recommend works awesome fits my hand nicely and has quick response times

- A worthwhile upgrade to a mouse that was already among the best.  The fact that it can work properly on more surfaces and has a lower click noise makes it perfect for working anywhere you may be.

- Upgraded from a MX Master 3 and found this to be more appropriate for a workplace. Extremely quiet clicks and great polling rate.

- Very nice mouse. Excellent upgrade compared to the previous version.

- Very similar to the 3.  The 3S is Logi Bolt compatible and NOT Unifying Receiver compatible.  As of today, these are two completely separate and similar technology.  Bolt is newer, more secure and can be trained up to 3 separate Bolt receivers.  The Master Keys Mini is also Bolt compatible.   The quiet clicking is something that I do enjoy better and I also prefer Bolt as that s what my peripherals are moving towards.  Do not expect a night and day difference to Master MX 3.   I have not been able to see a difference when it comes to the benefits of the higher PPI tracker.I have very large hands, and this is very comfortable to me.   People with smaller hands may find it too large.  This is a right-handed product... lefties should look elsewhere.

- Switched from the magic mouse on my mac book and will never look back.

- Amazing mouse, I like that you can connect up to three computers and switch between them, I totally recommend this if you can get it.

- Solid mouse. Coming from an MX Master 2S there are some small changes but overall the same mouse. Software is intuitive and build quality feels solid. Gesture button does feel a bit spongy and have yet to see how the gesture button holds up over time considering historical issues with the gesture button  sticking  on the 2S. Silent clicks are a welcome addition. Overall, a solid purchase if it holds up in the long term.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech doesn t need any introduction and I have been an avid user of Logitech computer accessories for as long as I can remember. I have been working as a Mechanical Design Engineer for more than 10 years now and Logitech is the only brand that I use for my mouse. I spend 90% of my time at job using mouse to 3D design stuff on software such as Creo, NX and SolidWorks. I cannot even imagine using any other brand mouse. I started with G602 that had 9 programmable buttons and anyone with even a little design experience can understand how much of a life saver that mouse is. Unfortunately, that started giving some issues after more than 5 years of service and I replaced it with MX Master 2S and OMG, that was a game a changer too. I agree, it didn t have as much programmable buttons but I still was able to make full use of few that are provided.The MX Master 2S was a fantastic mouse, but I had two complaints about it: 1) It used Micro USB instead of Type C and 2) the thumb wheel and navigation buttons were hard to use. The MX Master 3S fixes both those problems. The thumb wheel now has a very high quality feel to it and is very easy to spin around, and they ve moved the navigation buttons lower down to make them easier to press with your thumb. The main scroll wheel has also been made quieter, and somehow even more fun to use. As before, this mouse works on pretty much all surfaces, can connect to 3 devices, and can connect by either bluetooth or a USB dongle. I ve had no issues using it on both a Mac and PC. Logitech claims a battery life of 70 days, and while I obviously haven t been able to test that out yet, if the MX Master 2S is anything to go by, you can expect great battery life on this mouse too. The 3S has significantly better placement for my average sized hands. On the 2S, it required pulling my thumb so far back, that it initially felt like my thumb was going to dislocate. On the 3S that isn’t a problem.The vertical scroll wheel is great. Feels much better than the scroll wheel on the 2S, but it may take some fiddling with the Logitech Options program to get it to automatically switch to free scrolling based on your desired speed. The default setting switches it too easily, and the jump from ratcheted scrolling to free scrolling speed is significant. You might find yourself wanting to just scroll a few lines faster, and then suddenly you’re all the way at the bottom of a webpage.It s a big upgrade from Master 2S. However, if you own a Master 3, getting a 3S would not be much of an upgrade for you. The only difference between the two are that 3S has a 8000 DPI sensor where as 3 has 4000 DPI sensor. The other difference is that Logitech claims that 3S has 90% quieter clicking than 3.There is no question the placement of the back and forward buttons has been improved as well as the horizontal scrolling wheel as compared to 2S. The tracking also seems more precise. The gesture button is also vastly improved and now has an actual physical button. This mouse unequivocally earns a high five stars rating from me, along with my honest and very hearty recommendation. You will never see a mouse more ergonomic and comfortable to use than this one!

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the original MX Master since it came out a few years ago as my daily driver for work. I have also skipped the past versions as well. So, on first impressions, the fundamental design remains almost the same. It is still for right-handed people, the thumb rests comfortable on the rubber “winglet”, it promotes a “palm rest” use, and has similar weight. There are also significant changes. The side-scroll wheel is larger, the back-forward buttons are now below it, and the scroll wheel is larger and all metal. I will say that I do prefer the back-forward buttons on the side as they seem a bit out of place under the side-wheel. The right-left buttons are smaller but are pushed forward a bit more and the right one protrudes further. I had to get used to it, but it only took a few hours before things became second nature. Overall, I find the ergonomics comfortable for my medium-sized hands.I tried connecting via USB-C wired, Bluetooth, and the included 2.4Ghz receiver across a Windows laptop, an iOS tablet, and an Android tablet. All connected properly with no issues.  Switching between them is a breeze by pressing the buttons below the mouse. According to Logitech, the battery life can last for 70 days, and it seems that this may be true since I’ve been using it for days and it still shows up as full. Plus, the mouse features quick-charging where 1 minute provides 3 hours of use -very nice!The buttons and wheels are very responsive, and I am grateful that they are very quiet -useful while late night browsing! The underside allows for easy gliding across several surfaces (hard or soft). The mouse is easy to pick up and drop easily as well. While I might not be fully sold on the placement of the forward-back buttons, they make it easy to move between web pages. Since I work heavily with spreadsheets and data, the MagSpeed scroll wheel is of great benefit. The same goes with the side-scroll wheel. Managing long websites, text, and video editing becomes so much easier. Just in case the stock settings do not do it for you, Logitech provides the Logi Options app, where you can easily customize the buttons, add macros, adjust the gesture button and scroll wheels specific to the software or program, and even device being used. I especially appreciate changing the DPI. There you can manage all compatible Logi devices as well. At the end of the end Logitech has got a great thing going with the MX Master series. While there’s nothing wrong with the original, I am glad that now the MX Master 3s features USB-C, great battery life, and super quiet buttons. It may be pricier than other options, but what it brings to the table is well worth it in my opinion.

- Finally - All the features of MX series with softer clicks and newer wireless tech, and improved tracking on shiny/glass surfaces!I m already a BIG fan of the MX series, owning a full-size MX Mechanical keyboard and a separate Craft keyboard for my second workstation at my desk (for my creative work!). I also have both an MX Master 3 and an MX Vertical mouse, and the MX Anywhere portable mouse for travel (spoiler alert, I m a Logitech peripheral fan!). Alas, I loved the MX series, but the MX Master 3 (and the MX Master and MX Master 2 I owned before it) all suffered from very loud click sounds from the primary left and right mouse buttons. Some people like the click, but those people aren t married to my wife! :)The MX Master 3S is the perfect companion to my new MX Mechanical keyboard - Its smoothness doesn t disappoint. ALL of the MX Master features are here, including customizability, scrolling control (choice between stopped/clutched and smooth scrolling and compatibility with Logitech s own receiver format, and bluetooth PCs, tablets, phones and other compute devices.There are a few quirks as well, mostly due to a generational leap that Logitech is making across the MX series starting with the Master 3S and MX Mechanical: - This mouse is NOT compatible with Logitech s UNIFYING receivers that they ve been including with peripherals for YEARS now. They have upgraded it to a new technology called Logitech BOLT which will replace UNIFYING in their lineup. BOLT has some technical advantages, such as reduced USB bandwidth and I believe better coverage/reduced latency but this will disappoint those who are only upgrading one peripheral and expected backwards compatibility with their other desktop components. BOLT is the new UNIFYING at Logi, but you ll need to upgrade everything to take advantage. BOLT devices can t work with a UNIFYING receiver, and UNIFYING compatible devices won t work with a BOLT receiver. Its a lose-lose on compatibility. Thankfully Bluetooth is Bluetooth and supports all, but if you use the receivers, you ll need two to support mixed old/new standards. - Just as with the hardware, the software is being replaced also- Gone is support for Logitech Options, the keyboard and mouse customization software for the rest of the MX series, to be replaced by Logitech Options+, which gets nary a mention on their Options website. I spent about 30 minutes troubleshooting how I had the latest version of Options and STILL couldn t see my MX Master 3S in its configuration screen. The good news here is that Options+ DOES support many of the older MX series items also, so upgrading to it in a mixed estate should be no problem.All in all this is a generational change, which will delight some and infuriate others, but I m so happy to have this device, as well as the rest of the EXCELLENT MX Series, in the stable. I loved it so much I went out and added an MX Mechanical to the set (which I will review separately) just to have everything on my station on BOLT and Options+ and to take advantage of its improvements. The new MX Series devices are worthy of the name!

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Logitech has pretty much cornered the market for excellent quality mice, trackballs and keyboards. I can t really think of any other brand to consider when I m in the market for one of these devices. And, this holds true for the latest MX Master 3S mouse. I normally use a trackpad with my Mac, but wanted to give the Logitech mouse a spin. The build quality is excellent and the configurability options are almost endless. You can literally change every button and the scroll wheels to do almost anything you want when picking from a very long list of possibilities. Although the default options for each button/scroll wheel make the most sense, I changed a few to suit my needs and workflow better. The only real issue I had and I have with any of these Logitech products is the software. It tends to be a bit buggy, especially at the time of original installation. I already had Logitech Options installed on my Mac, but to use this mouse ones needs Options+. The Options software told me I needed to update to Options+, but didn t tell me how. Any other software will have an  update  option in one of the drop down menus, but Options did not. After about 15 minutes of trying to figure out what to do, I finally realized I just need to go the website and download the latest version of regular Options after which I would be guided to update to Options+. None of that made any sense, but I finally got it figured out. However, I can imagine someone who is not as techy as me would probably need to contact Logitech support.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Summary: Probably the best mouse I have ever owned. It has outstanding customization features for major productivity products (Office, Adobe, etc), great ergonomics and high quality build.Pros:Build qualityComfortPerformanceStyleEase of useCustomizationBattery lifeBluetooth or USB wirelessCons:Dongle is USB-A onlyUnboxing / setup:The package is small and has the essentials, the mouse, a dongle (USB-A) and warranty info. Setup is easy. With the dongle you can just plug it into the system and the mouse is automatically paired. If you want to connect via bluetooth, long press the connection button on the bottom and pair via your computer. I highly recommend you install the Logitech software from the website as it will allow you to customize buttons/wheels with specific programs such as excel, photoshop and more.Build quality:The quality of this device is outstanding. It uses some sort of magnetic scrolling so the wheels feel buttery smooth. Button clicks are good and the device feels sturdy.Use: I test with a windows laptop, a Mac Mini and a Galaxy Tab 8 Ultra in Dex mode. All devices are easily supported or paired to the mouse. The PC and mac allow for 8k DPI mode which for me was a bit too fast but for some will allow insane amounts of accuracy. The scroll wheels are very useful, especially the horizontal wheel. On Mac it is great for scrolling through books, magazines and more whereas in productivity software it is great for navigation on spreadsheets, moving around zoomed photos and so on. The thumb rest area has a hidden button that you can use for multiple things. I use it for selection between open windows similar to alt-tab. Bluetooth seemed a little laggy to me in comparison to using the dongle but it was still useful. The USB-A dongle was a non issue for me but if you are using this with a device that is only equipped with USB-C this might be an issue without an adapter.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m very experienced with the MX Master Mouse (having owned the original MX Master), which worked perfectly on Windows.  I recently bought a brand-new MacBook Pro M1 Pro with the Silicon ARM Chip, and I also bought the MX Master 3 Mouse.  Unfortunately, the Logitech Options software you download in order to program the mouse didn’t work with the MacBook Pro, which was a major disappointment.  Until just recently, Logitech still hadn’t optimized the Intel based software for the Logitech Options App (the app you use to program functionality on the mouse) to run on the Silicone ARM technology of a MacBook Pro, so sadly, even with Logitech Technical support help, I had to return it. To Logitech’s credit, days after returning the mouse they sent me an updated link they said would work with an MX Master 3 on a Silicon ARM Based MacBook Pro. I stored the link hoping I’d get another opportunity to use a MX Master.  That day came when I got the newest MX Master 3s.  So, did it work?  Yes, yes it did!  Using the updated Logitech Options Installer, it installed perfectly, and I was able to program the mouse to my specific needs.  To say I’m a Happy Camper is an understatement.Now that I’ve gotten the pre-story out of the way, let’s talk about this mouse.  If you’ve never had the pleasure of owning a Logitech MX Master Mouse, you simply have no idea what you’re missing.  It may seem odd to wax enthusiastic over a mouse, but the MX Master is worthy of such praise.  And this newest MX Master 3s even more so.It’s now even more ergonomic.  It just fits your hand so perfectly.  It’s made of premium plastics (recycled to save the planet) and this version doesn’t show fingerprints.  They come with a battery which lasts a LONG time.  A very LONG time.  The new MX Master 3s can go up to 70 days on a single charge.  My original MX Master lasted a long time as well, so I have every expectation the 3s will live up to what Logitech claims.You need to go to Logitech.com and download the Logitech Options App. It is very easy to use and lets you customize so many aspects of the mouse.  You can change the pointer speed.  You can Program the second scroll wheel on the side of the mouse.  I use it as volume up and down.  You have two buttons underneath the second scroll wheel, which I have programmed as forward and back.  And there’s yet another button where your thumb rests, which I’ve set up for Universal Control.  You can choose from many other options to suit your workflow.The primary scroll wheel is magical.  There’s the traditional mouse click we’re all used to.  And a tap of the button behind the wheel, releases what Logitech calls Magspeed.  The wheel is magnetic and has no, none, zip friction.  You can scroll faster than you’ve ever scrolled before.  And the scroll wheel also can be clicked and programmed for a number of functions.  I have mine programmed to zoom, which is very cool.The mouse can be paired with up to three different devices and all you need to do is tap the pairing button on the bottom of the mouse to switch between paired devices.  This mouse can scan up to 8000 DPI, for ultra-smooth and accurate scrolling.  The mouse can connect with Windows, Chrome, Linux, iPadOS , Android and MacOS.  And if you don’t have Bluetooth, it does come with a USB Receiver.  One of the best upgrades over previous MX Master Mice is how unbelievably quiet the 3s is.  You can’t hear the wheels scroll.  More importantly, you can’t hear the right or left mouse clicks.  How refreshing to have a mouse which does so much, yet so incredibly quiet.  If you haven’t gathered from what I’ve written, I’m quite enamored with the Logitech MX Master 3s.  They took everything that was already good in previous MX Master Mice and improved it significantly.  And now, I’m able to use it on a MacBook Pro M1 Pro Silicon ARM Based laptop.  Is it worth the price of admission?  Yes, yes it is.  Just get one.  You simply won’t regret it.

- Love the 8000 DPI, definitely noticeable.  Other than that it’s pretty much the same as it’s previous version. The 8000 DPI made it worth it to upgrade to this version.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the original MX Master mouse for a handful of years.  I use it daily, especially since working from home for the past couple years.  It is not a high-performance gaming mouse.  It does not have 15,000 dpi, a sub 60g weight, or on-the-fly dpi switching.  What it does have is incredible battery life, ergonomics, and the best scroll wheel I have ever used.  This new 3S model takes everything I love about daily driving the MX Master for work, and adds to it.  Button presses still have a positive bump, but the switches are near silent.  No more click-clacking around a spreadsheet.  The buttons are super quiet.  The shape has changed a bit and does not feel as wide as my original MX, but it is still every bit as comfortable.  It s a joy to use on a daily basis, with a good weight for productivity tasks.  It s a heavier mouse, but again this is not an ultralight gaming mouse, which is fine.  Also, this new model charges via USB-C instead of the micro-USB on the older model, which is always a welcome change.  Overall I would highly recommend this new MX model for anybody looking for a high quality comfortable mouse that does not need to be charged very often.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you re familiar with the MX Master line of mice, then this will be entirely familiar. It was already a good product, but Logitech has still managed to find way to tweak the design. First, the Logo Options + software is now out of beta, and the minor issues have been fixed. Besides giving you enhanced ability to redefine what each button does, the software also allows you to assign functions to buttons depending on which app you re currently using. So, for example, the side scroll wheel could switch between tabs in your browser but scroll side to side in your Excel workbooks. The main applications that come with preset tailored functions are Chrome, Edge, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, and Word, but you can add just about any application on your computer for customized settings. The main scroll wheel still does its thing where it will sense when you re trying to scroll a lot and start to spin freely for extended scrolling. You can also turn that  clicking  off and on for the scroll wheel just by clicking it, but I found that it still scrolls in small jumps on the screen, so I prefer to leave those magnetic  clicks  on for regular use. I also really appreciate the presence of that side scroll wheel over having to use buttons or push the center scroll wheel side to side. It s just better ergonomically. And overall, the ergonomics of the mouse are still superb. The main left and right click buttons are quieter, as advertised, but I m not sure how important that really is. If you haven t updated your mouse in awhile, this is good option.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used every iteration of the MX Master series mice and was looking forward to getting this newest version. It definitely does not disappoint, and I highly recommend this mouse.Packaging is typical for Logitech and refreshingly simple.  It comes with the mouse, USC C charging cable and the Logi Bolt USB receiver (I have never needed this for any version of this mouse as I connect via Bluetooth).The only issue I came across was with setting this mouse up.  I had been using the MX master 2S mouse for a year and it connected immediately.  This one took about 20 minutes as my 3 month $2700 laptop would not pair with the product. I then tried to connect through the Logi Options software but came to find out this mouse needed a different software called Logi Options + in order to unwrap all the great features, assign buttons, etc. Had to remove Logi Options, install Logi Options +, then reboot and then it connected quickly. It would have been nice to know it needed a different software from the beginning – would have saved a lot of time.  Operation of this mouse is flawless and unbelievably works on ANY surface, even a clear glass top table. Programming the buttons through the software was simple and of course you can change the speeds of the cursor movement as well as the 2 buttons near the thumb under the thumb scroll to your liking.  Ergonomically, this is the best feeling, most comfortable mouse of the MX series. Overall – I highly recommend this mouse as it does what it touts and does it extremely well.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Truly one of the most comfortable mice I ve ever used. I ve been using Logitech s MX Master Mouse 2 for a few years now, and I ve had nothing but good experience with it. This updated version is no different. The first thing that really jumps out at you is just how quiet it is. While you may not necessarily think about how loud mouse clicks are, this mouse will make you realize just how loud they used to be. Each click feels great but is very quiet. It s almost inaudible. That s not to say that there s any question as to whether you ve clicked though, it is still very easy to tell when you ve clicked the buttons, they re just almost silent. The material of the mouse is very nice too. It has an almost soft touch feel that s very nice. That along with the quietness gives the mouse a very premium feel. The position of the side wheel has taken a little getting used to, as I was so used to the MX Master Mouse 2, and this one is positioned a bit higher it seems. If you ve used an MX Master before, you ll know they also have this great feature of where you can kind of spin the middle mouse button wheel quickly and it will switch from a click-y type of scrolling to a free-moving wheel for quicker scrolling. This new one has the same option, but again, the operation of the switch between types is very quiet. It has other great features too, like being able to connect to 3 different devices and quickly switching between them. Logitech s software for customizing the mouse is also great and easy to use. If there is anything that I can maybe complain about with this mouse, is that the soft touch material is kind of a magnet to dust and fuzz.Pros: Premium feel, extremely quiet, very precise and responsive, great software and customizationCons: Soft touch can be a magnet for dust/fuzz

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m a big fan of Logitech computer accessories and I have owned a bunch of their MX line of products. I currently use the MX Master 2S and still working great for me. I expect the same from this next generation MX Master and it hasn’t disappointed me.It now uses USB-C instead of microUSB for charging. The charging port is still located on the front of the mouse so you can use it while it is charging not like the Apple mouse. It lost the 3 LED battery level indicator that was on the 2S which was helpful and it is now replaced with one LED battery indicator. The location of the two side buttons is moved to just under the side scroll wheel. The button click is virtually noiseless. It is that quiet. The scroll wheel in the ratchet mode is also quieter than the previous. It is also faster and more precise.It works on any surface with the upgraded 8000 DPI sensor compared to the 2S that had 4000 DPI.  You can customize the sensitivity through the app. Whether it be wood, metal, cloth, mousepad or even my glass sliding door, it works on all of those surfaces. The glide strips makes for a very smooth movement across the surface. I am using this mouse on Apple devices and they have this feature called Universal Control which lets you use one keyboard and mouse to control your Apple devices simultaneously. With Logitech Options+ and this Flow enabled mouse, you can now control a Mac and Windows computers with one mouse. You can transfer files, copy on one and paste on the other. Wait what? Mac and Windows working together? Yep It’s true! This Logi Flow cross-computer control works pretty seamless too but I think Apple’s Universal Control is more seamless. It still has the ability to connect to three different devices with the easy switch button on the bottom of the mouseThe ergonomic design feels the same as the 2S and the build quality is just as good. The color scheme changed from a gray two tone to a black two tone. The scroll wheels no longer have the rubber outer layer but it doesn’t affect the grip in my opinion. This Master 3S looks and feels great and it works great too.It comes with a Logi Bolt USB receiver and a USB-A to USB-C cable. This mouse is not compatible with the USB Unifying receiver.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Right off the bat I can honestly say that I recommend this upgraded Logitech MX Master 3S Wireless Laser Mouse with Ultrafast Scrolling being it s made by Logitech.Inside the package is the new upgraded MX Master 3S mouse, Bolt USB receiver, and USB-C charging cable and user documentation. The Bolt receiver is resemblance to the Unifying Receiver from the last model, however, this connects via Logitech Options+ software and not the regular Logitech Options software. The mouse itself is identical to its older sibling the MX Master 3 Wireless Laser Mouse, that I reviewed a couple years ago. On looks alone, everything looks the same.Simply pop the Bolt USB Receiver into a free USB port on your laptop/desktop and its ready to go. However, its recommended to download and install the Logitech Options+ software as stated above. This allows you to tweak the settings to your liking. The build quality is solid and sturdy as we ve all come to love about Logitech products.In this upgraded model, Logitech fined tuned an already awesome wireless laser mouse with ultrafast scrolling and made it better. Precision and movement is like buttery smooth. The DPI is now 8000 compared to 4000 and the left and right button clicks are ever so quiet. In the MX Master 3 you can hear and audible click when you press down on the buttons, but on the 3S there s no click sound. This was the first thing I noticed after I got everything installed and loaded. My favorite feature on both the 3 and 3S is that ultrafast flywheel. You can spin that scroll wheel as if you re on The Price is Right, or you can press the button below the scroll wheel and switch the wheel mode into more of a line by line scroll. This mouse can also be connected via Bluetooth instead of the Bolt USB receiver. Bluetooth mode is great for when I want to connect it to my iPad.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Coming from an MX Master 2S, the 3S is a very good upgrade.  The main button action is softer, the scroll wheels are fluid, and the DPI settings are ultrafine and ultrafast...and probably way more than I need.  Overall, the mouse is incredibly comfortable in the hand and button placement is intuitive.  If there is one thing I would love for Logitech to bring back would be a main scroll when that also moves side-to-side.This is a rechargeable mouse and I m happy that it includes USB-C for the charging port (as opposed to micro-USB.)Control of the mouse uses the updated Logi Options +, and I m happy to see this updated software covers all of the basics in a simpler interface and gives many button/wheel configuration options.  Some older Logitech peripherals are not yet compatible with Options +.One other thing:  This mouse can connect via Bluetooth or the newer Logi Bolt receiver (as opposed to the Unifying receiver.). I m not sure it this receiver is backwards compatible, but it appears all of Logitech s newer peripherals are making the switch.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pros:-Mouse can be used on virtually any surface, including glass-Ergonomic; comfortable with any grip-Very silent-Pairs with up to 3 devices so you can switch between them (can only use with one device at a time)-Long battery life-Very smooth scroll and thumb wheels-Extremely customizable when used with Logitech s Options+ software-Logitech Flow allows use of mouse between up to 3 PCs at the same time and copy/paste across them-8000DPI sensor for quicker movement on high resolution displaysQuestionable Pro:-Uses Bolt receiver, which supposedly provides a more reliable connectionCons:-May be jarring to users of the older MX Master series mice at first due to all the changes they made-Bolt receiver is not backwards compatible and doesn t support Unifying receiver devices-145Hz polling rate means it s not made for serious gamers-Flow only compatible with Windows and MacOS-(for left-handed people) It s a right-handed mouseQuestionable Con:-Battery indicator is now just one bigger LED, no longer showing levelsFor some reason in 2022, Logitech appears to be the only brand with mice on the market that tracks on glass. So if you have a glass table to use your mouse on like I do, and don t want to use a mouse pad, Logitech s MX series of mice appear to be your only option. Thankfully, Logitech does an amazing job with the MX Master line making it feel like a premium device that it s worth.Thanks to its ergonomic design, it never feels uncomfortable using the MX Master 3S. It s tall enough and curved in the right way to allow your hand and fingers to naturally rest on it. The soft rubberized texture of the base provides a comfortable feel. I ve used the mouse all day and my wrist never feels tired from it.What s new to the MX Master 3S that was absent from the Master MX 3 that preceded it are the silent left and right click buttons. What was once the loudest parts of mouse, on the 3S it s now the most quietest. The amazing thing is, it still feels tactile. It doesn t feel mushy or suppressed. You ll feel the click like you always do. It s just A LOT less noisy. The change is so dramatic that you may hate initially, like I did. I wanted a silent mouse, but when I first used the 3S I instantly felt regret and frustration. My brain was so used to expecting a sound when I click that when I didn t with the 3S it felt extremely jarring to me. I think I may have been clicking harder than I needed to out of reflex. Fortunately, within a half hour, maybe an hour at most, I got used to the silent click and wound up falling in love with it like I thought it would. Oh my GOD, I *WISH* I had this 20 years when I was up using a computer during late hours when my parents expected me in bed.The left/right click buttons aren t the only thing that s gone quieter. The scroll wheel is also a lot more quiet, even in ratchet mode, where the wheel has tactile  steps  when you spin it.The back/forward side buttons are also relatively quiet.All in all this mouse seems to be designed to work quietly. The loudest part of the mouse is probably the thumb button.None of the buttons feel cheap. They all have a pleasant tactile responsive feel. No soft mushy feel. No sticky feel.The thumb button is easier to find and on the MX Master 3S than the 2S and older because it has a very slight bump to help feel your way to locating it. It also feels easier to press because there is now a groove on the side of the mouse to allow the button to be pressed deeper. You won t accidentally press it while resting your thumb there because of where the button is placed, in the center of the base of mouse on the left side. It s hard for me to explain. It s not easy to press the button by accident, but it s easy to press the button when you need to.There are 2 wheels on the mouse, the scroll wheel in between the left/right click buttons for scrolling with your index finger, and the thumb wheel on the side for scrolling with your thumb. There is no longer the rubberized coating on the wheels but they still have a good feel to them. I like this change as I imagine the wheel will be easier to clean over time as it collects dirt and grime. The rubber from the older versions made it tougher to clean as dirt would stick to it. Now it s just all steel.The thumb scroll wheel is now placed above the back/forward buttons instead of beside them.Thanks to this, the thumb scroll wheel is in its own row and the wheel is now wider making it more easier to use than ever before.The scroll wheel has SmartShift, which automatically switches the scroll wheel from line-by-line scrolling to hyper-fast scrolling when you scroll faster.Or you can use the Shift wheel mode button below the scroll wheel to switch between Ratchet (tactile steps) and Free spin (no tactile steps) immediately.With the use of Logitech s Options+ software, the mouse is extremely customizable. Every button on the mouse can be remapped. You can even map buttons for specific applications only, instead of making the changes global.With Options+ you can also change the speed of both wheels, as well as change the direction of the scrolling of the wheels.You can also change the pointer speed by changing the sensor range. The range is from 200DPI to 8000DPI by steps of 50 DPI. The default DPI out of the box, and without the Options+ software is 1000DPI. I found 8000DPI way too fast and frenetic for me to be precise with it with my use case, even though I have a 3 monitor setup with 4K monitors, but this may be helpful for others with a more expensive setup like a multi-monitors using 8K monitors which have twice as many pixels, making the average mouse pointer feel slower with the default sensor. The higher DPI sensor would allow the mouse pointer speed to move faster.The Options+ software is also where you can set up the MX Master 3S with Flow. Flow allows you to use and control multiple computers with Options+ also installed seamlessly. Switch to another computer by simply moving your cursor to the edge of the screen. Flow also allows your to copy and paste content between those computers. However, since Flow is dependent on the Options+ software, it s only compatible with Windows and MacOS. So there is no first-party solution from Logitech for Linux, Android, or iOS.Whereas  MX  meant the mouse employs Darkfield technology to allow tracking on virtually any surface, the  Master  means the mouse is able to pair with up to 3 devices. With a button found under the mouse, you can switch between those 3 devices. Out of the box,  1  is paired to the included Bolt receiver.What may comes as unfortunate news to loyal Logitech users is that the Bolt receiver is not compatible with devices that use the older Unifying receiver. First introduced with Logitech s business line of products, it was designed to be more secure and perform better under busy environments that would typically cause interference with the wireless connection. Typically when this happens, users are advised to get a USB extension cable to connect the USB receiver to, so you can bring it closer to the mouse for a more reliable connection. In theory, Bolt should help prevent this. Unfortunately, I m not in an environment with that kind of interference so I can t test this claim.Logitech claims it has a battery life of *up to* 70 days, carefully wording it so that 70 days is their claim max point. So don t expect 70 days. The reality is, how long it lasts will vary depending on the user and how they use it. For example, with me, I m on the computer almost all day and night, over 8 hours a day. I haven t owned the 3S long enough to test its battery life in real time to see it go from 100% to 0% but I ve seen it lose 10% of battery in my 3 days of use. That would amount to about 30 days, which is the same amount of battery life I got with my MX Master 2S, which Logitech also claimed  up to 70 days . So, if you re a previous MX Master 2S or Master 3 user, expect the same amount of battery life as that. To me, this is very good battery life, as I m an abnormal user. I spend way too much time on the computer. Perhaps the average user will get 45-50 days out of it. For someone like my mom, who is elderly and not on the computer as much, 70 days is definitely possible. This is thanks to how power efficient the mouse is. It goes into sleep mode after a long period of inactivity. I have never felt the need to power my mouse off.The mouse charges via USB-C, and Logitech claims 3 minutes of charging will give you about a full day s worth of use.I haven t been able to test this yet because I m still working with the initial charge that it came with out of the box, which was 45%. In 5 days of use, I ve only lost a reported 10%.That s a notable thing about the battery reporting with the MX Master 3S. You can only see the battery percentage through the Options+ app or bluetooth if you have it connected via bluetooth. And it only reports the battery percentage in intervals of 5%. So the 35% battery I m seeing now actually means 31% to 35%.The battery indicator on the MX Master 3S is just a single LED, albeit larger and easier to see. On the MX 2S and older, there were 3 LEDs so you could see the battery level. With one LED, you can now only see whether the battery is above 10% (green), below 10% (red), or charging (blinking). I honestly don t think this is that bad because when it turns red, that s your reminder to charge it or else it will die. And being in the red with 10% will give you 3 days of extensive usage to do it, which is plenty of time.For loyal MX Master mouse users coming from the 2S or older, you may be in for a real unpleasant shock from all the changes they ve made to the 3S. But give it time and you ll fall in love with it like I did. Bolt is the future, and Unifying will get phased out. Got to start somewhere. 3S is a great start.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I want to talk about the Logitech MX Master 3S Mouse in two parts:  as a mouse first and foremost and then with regard to its particular features.Mice have been around for a long time, and just like people are always trying to build a better mousetrap, they’re also always trying to build a better mouse.  The “original” modern mouse, if you want to call it that, and I do, can be traced back to the kidney-shaped, two-button, Microsoft Serial Ball Mouse.  Everything since then has been an improvement, or an attempt to improve, on this basic design.  Most mice since then have stayed with the standard oval or kidney shape, and most of these can work for either right- or left-handed people.Later mice have incorporated useful things like more buttons which can be separately programmed, scroll wheels, and a change from mechanical to optical tracking.  But most improvements nowadays are incremental.  The mouse clicks are a little quieter.  The scroll-wheel is more sensitive.  The tracking sensor is more precise.  There are extra buttons for customization.  Connection can be by more different ways now, too, like USB and Bluetooth, and wireless mice are now everywhere. But it’s still a mouse.  So let’s start with the basics.  This mouse starts off being very non-standard by being specifically designed for right-handed people.  It is highly non-symmetrical, with a large, low flange on the left side to hold your thumb. You can actually rest your thumb on this while using the mouse, not that keeping your thumb off the table is very difficult or tiring with a more conventional mouse.  But still, the little thumb support ledge feels just a bit more comfortable to hold.This is not a small mouse.  There are mice that tout that they are for small hands or large hands, and I’ve used both.  I have large hands, and large-hand mice, while not all that much larger, really, than “regular” mice, do feel slightly more comfortable.  As it sits on the table, the mouse is angled downward to the right, so your index finger sits a little above your middle finger. This shape conforms better to the natural shape of your hand, and, again, makes this mouse just a little more comfortable to hold and use.Overall, as a basic mouse, the MX Master 3S succeeds and then some. It is very comfortable to hold and has a nice heft and feel to it.  Now lets get to the specifics of this mouse.1.  The claim is that it can track on any surface.  As any seasoned optical mouse user surely knows, optical mice typically have a hard time with reflective or clear surfaces such as glass.  I encounter this problem often when traveling and am sitting at the desk in the hotel room, and the desk has a glass platen over the top of it to protect the wood finish.  Unless I remember to bring a mouse pad with me, which I never do, I end up having to get something opaque like a magazine or a folded newspaper and run the mouse over that.  This mouse eliminates this problem, a welcome feature.  To add to the benefit, the sensor is 8000 DPI and is customizable, making scrolling on any surface, glass or otherwise, more efficient.2.  Less click noise.  Not really a big deal.  I compared the click noise on this mouse with my previous mouse and the collection of mice I have in my cabinet.  None of them make much of a click noise, and I think the last time this was an issue was about 1990.  3.  Fast scrolling.  Yes, the main scroll wheel between the two main button is large, sculpted, and easy to use.  Sometimes I need to quickly get to page 16 of a 35 page Word document, and being able to scroll quickly to get there is greatly appreciated.4.  Customizable buttons.  To access this, you need to download and install the Logi Options+ software.  Customizable buttons are nothing new, and having to download software to program them is also nothing newr.  In addition to the two main mouse buttons and scroll wheel, there are two buttons, one in front of the other, just above where your thumb sits, a smaller scroll wheel just above those two buttons, also designed to be operated by your thumb, and a much smaller button just behind the main scroll wheel.  Program these for your favorite software.  I have to admit that I’ve never been much of a mouse button programmer for the simple reason that I can never remember what I programmed a particular button to do.  If I did some action often enough in some piece of software, I could see programming a button to quicken this process, but I normally don’t.  But it’s there if I need it.5.  Connectivity is by USB or Bluetooth.  In both situations, the mouse can be programmed to work with up to three different devices.  Being able to use the same mouse at home on my desktop and then away from home on my laptop can be particularly useful if I have programmed one or more buttons to work with specific software.  I just have to remember to take the mouse with me when I travel!  The mouse can be also be connected to different operating environments, such as Window OS on this computer MacOS on that computer, Linux on another computer, and so forth.  This can be very handy for some people.One thing that threw me for a loop briefly when I first took the mouse out of the box was powering it. I assume I would have to insert one or maybe two AA batteries, which is common for wireless mice.  But I quickly found that there was no battery compartment, and a quick check of the box revealed that the battery is permanent and is rechargable through a USB-C port on the front edge of the mouse.  There is no mention of this in the paper documentation, only on the exterior of the box.  It says that a one-minute charge yields three hours of use while a full-charge can last 70 days.  I have not tested the latter claim, and I decided to simply charge the mouse for an hour before using it the first time.  I’ve been using it since then for about four days, and I’ve had no power issues.  I do switch the mouse off when not using it to conserve battery life.  A USB-2 to USB-C cable is included, so the mouse can be charged from most any USB-2 wall adapter, not to mention a computer with a USB-2 port.  I used my cell-phone’s USB-C wall charger and cable to charge this mouse.  While not intended to be accessed regularly, instructions are provided on removing the lithium battery should it ever need to be replaced.This mouse has become my main mouse. I would like it if it had nothing more than the unusual, hand-shaped design with thumb rest.  I have used unusually-shaped mice before, but none have been comfortable enough to become my main mouse.  But this one is different.  Highly recommended if for no other reason than that.  The rest is gravy.

- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I ve been using this new MX Master for the past couple days of work, syncing this both to my work computer and personal computer. I have the original MX Master from 2017 and its been nice noticing the upgrades and changes that have come along in the last 5 years. The form factor feels better in my hand and I like the visual aesthetic with some harder edges that the original. There were two major features that Logitech highlighted with the release of the 3S: Softer click buttons and a finer DPI laser that allows you to use the mouse on any surface. I m not sure if I were buying this in a vacuum I would notice how soft the buttons are, but when comparing to the original Master the sound of clicking is night/day different and allows my to click around through documents while on calls without my mic picking it up. While I confess that I did not try the mouse on glass, I was really impressed with how smooth this mouse moves on cork, leather and wood. I feel confident that it would be smooth on any conference room table or office setup and allows you to move exactly where you want. In short this mouse will work with any device - I ve connected it to my work ChromeOS and MacOS machines and my personal Windows 11 machine, provides high quality movement on any surface, is extremely (ALL DAY) comfortable in your hand, and has made notable improvements on what was already a great platform. I highly recommend this as the best mouse you can buy for a home office

- I purchased this mouse to replace a cheap Microsoft mouse provided by my employer.  I could not be more happy.  I was concerned how long the charge would last but I have had it for 10 days and it is still at 90%.  Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.

- Logitech - MX Master 3S is a upgrade from my MX Master 3.  I prefer this version over the older one due to its quietness on clicking.  I enjoy clicking the mouse without the noise.

- The new silent feature in the 3S is fantastic! The same great feel as the original MX Master is great, and the multi-device connection makes going between work and personal seamless.

- Same as the old MX Master 3 - the best in my opinion but with less click noise

- I work from home and on the computer all day. This mouse is one of the best investments I’ve made. Worth every penny.

- This is the best mouse I ve ever used. The ability to program all of the buttons, and there are several of them, makes this a super versatile product. Additionally, the fast-scroll wheel and the ergonomics make this a perfect 5 out of 5 stars.

- Imagine cutting a stick of butter with a hot knife? Oh well, the glide on this thing is godly! I ve been around a lot of mice in my day. I thought the magic mouse was the best thing since sliced bread. I was wrong MX S3 really is in a class of its own it also has the 8k DPI if you re a gamer then this mouse is also useful to you!

- A must have for your work flow. The customization that automatically adjusts depending on the app your in is a must.

- This is the perfect mouse.  The 3S clicking is super quiet. I don t hear my clicks at all with the AC or ceiling fan running in my house.  Way better than the super loud clicks of the MX Master 3.  The MX Master 3 should ve originally came with these same quiet clicks when it was released back in 2019.

string(8478) "Take this List of reviews: 

- Bought this mouse to use for work and it has been great. So much better than using a standard mouse.

- Excellent mouse! I previously had the MX Master 2 and 3. Saw this was out and even though the changes are minor I had to get it. Highly recommended. I love how quiet it is now.

- Don t bother. But the non-S model on sale instead.Incredible build quality! But the bolt connection is incompatible with all unifying receiver products (which are far more numerous). And the easy-switch function is still tied to the button on the bottom of the mouse. (And you still can t reassign the function in their software either. I tried) The mouse click IS mostly silent, just as advertised. And there s a better sensor now. But literally nothing else has changed that matters. Get the non-S model instead. It has everything that s great about this mouse. But more compatible and sometimes on sale.

- my one gripe is that it doesn t work on OSX Mojave as Options+ is 10.15+ only. BUT I absolutely love this mouse. The Master 3 click were so loud, it felt obnoxious clicking it while on Zoom calls. The 3S fixed this and it s barely a whisper now. Absolutely well done Logitech!

- The MX Master 3 is one of the best mouses for productivity and while the 3S is mostly similar, the improvements are much welcomed and I ve been able to benefit from them so far. Here s what I like about it- Black over Graphite. I don t know why but the black just looks more premium over the previous graphite version.- Reduced clicking noise. The difference is VERY noticeable and I m sure my co-workers appreciate my less  obnoxious clicking sounds.- Improved DPI sensor. I ve tested it on my glass table and it works well. Although I don t work on it often, it s nice to have the ability to use my mouse now and not have to use my laptop s awful trackpad.

- I came from the MX Master 2S and this mouse is not only more comfortable, but also the click is SO quiet. 8K DPI isn t for me but for those that need it, it seems great.

- I upgraded from the MX Master 3 and to be honest I was not sure if this S version was not going to be worthwhile upgrade.  But after using this mouse for about a week, I must say I am very happy with this mouse.  The quite click was worth the upgrade.  The 3S is just as good as the MX Master 3.   Glad I upgraded.

- This a wonderful mouse.  It feels great and scrolls well.  Setup was easy using LogiOption+ , but.  I use Microsoft Office Pro 2019 but unfortunately the supplied applications for excel, PowerPoint, and Word, won’t install.  I’m waiting for Logitech technical support for a possible solution.  Regardless is excellent mouse.

- I ve used various versions of the MX Master and this continues the streak. The only small nitpick I have is I wish it was a little heavier or there was an option to add weights to it like their gaming mice.

- The silent click is a welcome improvement over the last model

- Very easy to use, love the scrolling feature and that it can change between laptops easily.

- Great mouse, though not light-years beyond the MX3 model.  Ultra-high DPI is nice.However, there is one huge flaw with this mouse - Logitech changed the wireless receiver standard from the Unifying spec to Logi Bolt.The Bolt is supposed to be more secure and use Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is nice, but they did not make it backwards compatible with devices that connect via the Unifying receiver!  Meaning, if you still use older Logitech hardware, you need to have two receivers connected to your laptop (where open USB ports may already be scarce).  In addition, I wanted to switch my mouse between my work and personal computers.  But now that this mouse only works with the Bolt, I would have to buy another Bolt receiver so I can interchange between the two machines.    *eye-roll*Sadly, I didn t know that Logitech was releasing this new standard, and it isn t well advertised on the packaging that it uses the Bolt, so it s easy to get surprised.  I contacted Logitech Tech Support and there seems to no plan to make Bolt compatible with devices that connected via Unifying.So, sadly I have to return this because the ability to switch the mouse between my machines on the fly was my main objective, and I refuse to buy another receiver because Logitech didn t think about making Bolt backwards compatible.

- I didn’t think this mouse could get any better, but here I am reviewing the newest version. The click sound is near nonexistent, the gliding on the desk is as smooth as ever, and the color looks extra rich and classy. There’s a new app to connect it to your PC, so I’d be weary of that. But otherwise once it’s working; it’s wonderful.

- As a Graphic Designer.. I m loving the productivity I m getting out of this mouse. I ve been using an Apple Magic Mouse for the past decade and this was just a great upgrade!

- Huge upgrade from my wired mouse. Zero wire drag. The clicks are the quietest I ever used. Super comfortable.With Logi app, setup your buttons and it saves in mouse.I used half a dozen of gaming mouse before, this blow it all away.

- It s weird to say I am excited about something like a mouse, but I am.I had the MX3 mouse and it was great but the MX3 S is even better. It is smoooooooth, and the clicking is quiet and just feels like.Well worth the $99 price tag.

- Superb mouse as expected. The buttons are very tactile while being very quiet. Expensive but worth the money if you do a lot of office work.

- my biggest qualms with the original MX Master 3 was the shrill, loud clicks and the fact that it came in a really ugly dark gray color alongside the horrendous native scrolling. i actually forced myself to use the magic mouse 2 for a while and through immeasurable pain because despite its awful shape, the magic mouse had really satisfying clicks and stupendously fluid scrolling.but after only a few hours of use all i can say is i absolutely love this newer version of master 3. firstly, it fixes the loud annoying clicks in exchange for a very subtle, bass heavy thocky sound instead that i just love. seriously, i cannot stress enough how much a silent, more satisfying tacticle click makes a difference in workflow. my m1 macbook pro is already dead silent, and in conjunction with this mouse i m basically working in absolute quiet.as far as scrolling goes, logitech hasnt done much to resolve that issue but using a program called MOS in conjunction with Options+ SmoothScrolling option I ve found a way to mimic the natural fluid scrolling of the magic devices, so i m happy in that regard as well. if logitech could look into making smoothscroll better this mouse would be peak.and finally, a truly black color. really the only way they could make this mouse better is if they provided a USBC dongle instead, but as is i m really happy to be able to throw my magic mouse away and my hand is eternally grateful for the lack of pain forthcoming

- I upgraded from a Master 2s from Logitech. That mouse was always so great! Plenty of features, plus lots of customizability. Now, the 3s takes everything that was great about the 2s and makes it even greater. The silent clicking in the buttons is a great touch, and it also feels lighter in the hand compared to my predecessor. Overall, if you have the money for it, do it. It’s a great tool to have both in productivity and creative apps.

- I love the mouse and this iteration will take some getting used to with the move of the side buttons but feels great.Thing to note:  The version I just purchased is NOT RF compatible...so read carefully before purchasing.  I have a number of devices on Unify and is much more reliable than BT.
