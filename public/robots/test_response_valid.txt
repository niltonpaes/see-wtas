string(144) "It's a very comfortable mouse and I personally found all the buttons very useful as a designer. It's proven to be one of the best mice out there"


string(51) "It's great - functionality plus comfort. I like it."


string(485) "At first, I thought that this mouse felt heavy, and would be more difficult to maneuver, coming from a smaller, lighter mouse. Shortly thereafter though, I am not going back. The mouse's design is extremely comfortable, and the sensor makes it easy to accurately target items on the screen, even at higher resolutions. It's increased my productivity immensely. Battery life is good, and it charges up quickly so you can get back to work. Well worth the cost - I would highly recommend!"


string(68) "pros:
- super smooth
- quiet clicks
- ergonomic shape
- quality feel"


string(95) "Great all around mouse. I do get some lagging here and there but I don’t game so it is minor."


string(1909) "With still no announcement of an MX master 4, the master 3S is often headlined as the best wireless mouse on the market. 

And theres a reason for that. 

+ Exeptional battery life. It claims 70 days. But if youre like me and turn off everything before you sign off for the day, and you can get up to 3 months of use out of this before you get the notification that you need to plug it in. I have a wireless keyboard and this mouse. Both use USB-C to charge. Simple and easy, one cable for everything. Flawless. *cough* APPLE *cough*. 

+ Great feel in the hand. This is not a perforated ultralightweight gaming mouse. Its an "everything" mouse for leisure, business, and noncompetitive gaming. Feels great ergonomically and fits your whole hand. If you have very small hands, this could be a little bit of a learning curve, but it should still be very easy to use once youre used to it. 

+ silent clicking. Go watch a youtube video between click sound of the MX 3 vs MX 3S. That will explain itself. 

+ two scroll wheels. Logitech has mastered (...lol) scroll wheels. Their metal, magnetic scroll wheels feel buttery smooth. And for you Excel users, horizontal scrolling is a life changing addition. 

+ 3 devices at once. I only use two, my desktop and laptop. And being able to quickly switch in between them is very nice. But this is not unique to this device as many wireless mice can do this. 

Bottom line is, if you have $100 and youre looking for the best wireless mouse available, theres no debate. Its this one. If youre a competitive gamer though.......your needs and expectations are different and you may want to look elsewhere depending on what youre looking for. But you already knew that. 

But for everyone who is NOT a competitive gamer, even for you casual gamers like me, you simply cannot go wrong with this mouse. Treat yo self. 

P.S..........................sorry left handers......"


string(219) "I love the feel of the mouse in your hand it fits like a glove. It is also extremely fast and easy to use. The multiple scrollers are also an awesome feature for fast scrolling not only up and down but sideways as well."


string(127) "Great mouse.  It is comfortable to use and responsive.  I previously used the Apple mouse, and found this to be an improvement."


string(56) "Excellent mouse, best one I’ve ever owned in 40 years!"


string(53) "Very smooth and responsive mouse. Great battery life."


string(51) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 2"


string(53) "Very smooth and responsive mouse. Great battery life."


string(56) "Never had a mouse like this before, so glad I bought it."


string(377) "I normally don't write reviews but this mouse is SO amazing I figured I would.  The speed scroll is awesome, makes moving through large spreadsheet so much faster but allows to slow it down if you don't need that feature.  The side scrolling adds a whole other dimension of efficiency of time to my work day.  There is a big ROI with the cost of this mouse.  Worth every penny!"


string(59) "So smooth way better than the Magic Mouse I’ve been using"


string(62) "with the drafting programs i use this is a really nice product"


string(199) "Had it for a couple weeks and its almost as good as my previous iteration of this same mouse from logitech. I say almost because this one doesnt sit as comfortably as my older one but its not too bad"


string(228) "Love this product; it connects instantly and is customizable to your needs in terms of the what you want buttons to execute. I should have bought this years ago; but it is a bit pricey. I would definitely recommend this product."


string(68) "The feel is great. I like color. Clicking from left right is smooth."


string(136) "The best mouse ever!!! I love this mouse and I’m a Designer so I was very careful in looking for my next mouse and this is a must buy!"


string(327) "Best invention ever!  Instead of using a separate mouse for my Mac and then plug in and unplug the usb to interchange between my home laptop and work laptop to use the mouse, this makes life so much easier.  I can interchange from my Mac to my home laptop and work laptop with a simple press of a button.  I highly recommend!!!"


string(51) "********************************* BESTBUY - Page: 3"


string(754) "Comfortable. Quiet. Smooth. Impressive.

There were two issues 1) quality control seems to be a bit of a problem. I ordered two of them and one was noticeably smoother than the other and just performed better. I'd recommend that if you receive it and you like it but it feels like its just short of perfect then exchange it for another. You just might get one that works perfectly. 

2) AVOID THE WHITE MODEL AT ALL COSTS. It changes to yellow after a few uses. Others have made the same comments. It seems to be an ongoing issue which reflects badly on this company that they would continue to distribute it. In any case, the white looks amazing but I am telling you... you need to avoid it anyway. It's really too bad because it was very sharp looking."


string(150) "Need a big grip? wanna free a USB port and connect via Bluetooth, wanna be able to add and edit features, customize buttons, look no more, this is it."


string(214) "The title says it all. My job software has a lot of drop down menus and boxes to click. The mouse is accurate and the click is soft and quiet. When your clicking a lot with a mouse that noise becomes very annoying."


string(63) "This mouse is the bee's knees. I'd recommend this device 10/10."


string(378) "This mouse is like having three mice in one.  It has a preset button underneath it and allows you to change PCs at the touch of a button.  

If desired, the mouse has a lot of configurable options via the Logitech software that you can download from their site for free.  It is not required for the mouse to work but it's there if you want to configure it to its fullest extent."


string(702) "The scroll wheel on this mouse is far and away the best I've ever used, and I use the horizontal scroll wheel far more than i thought I would. My only complaints are there's not a spot to store the USB receiver in the mouse (not a huge deal since it can connect to 3 Bluetooth devices) and the mouse has no onboard memory. The lack of onboard memory is the bigger issue, as I can't install the Options+ app on my work PC, meaning I am unable to take full advantage of the mouse on the PC where the customizability would be most useful. But even without onboard memory this is my favorite mouse I've used and I decided to keep it over the likes of the Logitech G604, Razer Basilisk, and JLab Epic Mouse."


string(462) "Mouse is great. Ergonomics are well designed and feel good. Connection is solid and fast (coming from usijg only gaming mice) but the issue is, the software slows the side scrolling down. Not sure why but when i delete the software the side scrolling returns to its smooth former self. With the software, side scrolling feels clunky and choppy. Such a bummer because you miss out on so many great perks of the software. Get the mouse, dont download the software."


string(195) "The best all-around mouse currently. Great for work, productivity, and just about everything. Not a top of the line mouse for gaming, but not bad. Overall, the best mouse on the market currently."


string(228) "Great Mouse. comfortable, fast and smooth. My only complain, if this counts as one, I will soon need to upgrade my current Logitech keyboard to one that accepts the Logi Bolt receiver. As of now those keyboards a very expensive."


string(538) "For context: I'm 6'4, large hands, and I use claw grip.

I love how this fits my hand even though I use claw grip.  The setup was fairly simple, I had a few questions but the "buddy" software it launches during setup helped a lot.  At base level this mouse is already awesome, but where it shines is the customization with the logitech software it launches, everything from custom button mapping, sensitivity, speed, gesture+button combinations - it's really great.  Switching between sources is seamless as well.  Definitely a great buy!"

string(5668) "Take this list of reviews of a product: 

- It s a very comfortable mouse and I personally found all the buttons very useful as a designer. It s proven to be one of the best mice out there

- It s great - functionality plus comfort. I like it.

- At first, I thought that this mouse felt heavy, and would be more difficult to maneuver, coming from a smaller, lighter mouse. Shortly thereafter though, I am not going back. The mouse s design is extremely comfortable, and the sensor makes it easy to accurately target items on the screen, even at higher resolutions. It s increased my productivity immensely. Battery life is good, and it charges up quickly so you can get back to work. Well worth the cost - I would highly recommend!

- pros:- super smooth- quiet clicks- ergonomic shape- quality feel

- Great all around mouse. I do get some lagging here and there but I don’t game so it is minor.

- With still no announcement of an MX master 4, the master 3S is often headlined as the best wireless mouse on the market. And theres a reason for that. + Exeptional battery life. It claims 70 days. But if youre like me and turn off everything before you sign off for the day, and you can get up to 3 months of use out of this before you get the notification that you need to plug it in. I have a wireless keyboard and this mouse. Both use USB-C to charge. Simple and easy, one cable for everything. Flawless. *cough* APPLE *cough*. + Great feel in the hand. This is not a perforated ultralightweight gaming mouse. Its an  everything  mouse for leisure, business, and noncompetitive gaming. Feels great ergonomically and fits your whole hand. If you have very small hands, this could be a little bit of a learning curve, but it should still be very easy to use once youre used to it. + silent clicking. Go watch a youtube video between click sound of the MX 3 vs MX 3S. That will explain itself. + two scroll wheels. Logitech has mastered (...lol) scroll wheels. Their metal, magnetic scroll wheels feel buttery smooth. And for you Excel users, horizontal scrolling is a life changing addition. + 3 devices at once. I only use two, my desktop and laptop. And being able to quickly switch in between them is very nice. But this is not unique to this device as many wireless mice can do this. Bottom line is, if you have $100 and youre looking for the best wireless mouse available, theres no debate. Its this one. If youre a competitive gamer though.......your needs and expectations are different and you may want to look elsewhere depending on what youre looking for. But you already knew that. But for everyone who is NOT a competitive gamer, even for you casual gamers like me, you simply cannot go wrong with this mouse. Treat yo self. P.S..........................sorry left handers......

- I love the feel of the mouse in your hand it fits like a glove. It is also extremely fast and easy to use. The multiple scrollers are also an awesome feature for fast scrolling not only up and down but sideways as well.

- Great mouse.  It is comfortable to use and responsive.  I previously used the Apple mouse, and found this to be an improvement.

- Excellent mouse, best one I’ve ever owned in 40 years!

- Very smooth and responsive mouse. Great battery life.

- Very smooth and responsive mouse. Great battery life.

- Never had a mouse like this before, so glad I bought it.

- I normally don t write reviews but this mouse is SO amazing I figured I would.  The speed scroll is awesome, makes moving through large spreadsheet so much faster but allows to slow it down if you don t need that feature.  The side scrolling adds a whole other dimension of efficiency of time to my work day.  There is a big ROI with the cost of this mouse.  Worth every penny!

- So smooth way better than the Magic Mouse I’ve been using

- with the drafting programs i use this is a really nice product

- Had it for a couple weeks and its almost as good as my previous iteration of this same mouse from logitech. I say almost because this one doesnt sit as comfortably as my older one but its not too bad

- Love this product; it connects instantly and is customizable to your needs in terms of the what you want buttons to execute. I should have bought this years ago; but it is a bit pricey. I would definitely recommend this product.

- The feel is great. I like color. Clicking from left right is smooth.

- The best mouse ever!!! I love this mouse and I’m a Designer so I was very careful in looking for my next mouse and this is a must buy!

- Best invention ever!  Instead of using a separate mouse for my Mac and then plug in and unplug the usb to interchange between my home laptop and work laptop to use the mouse, this makes life so much easier.  I can interchange from my Mac to my home laptop and work laptop with a simple press of a button.  I highly recommend!!!

string(4554) "Take this list of reviews of a product: 

- Comfortable. Quiet. Smooth. Impressive.There were two issues 1) quality control seems to be a bit of a problem. I ordered two of them and one was noticeably smoother than the other and just performed better. I d recommend that if you receive it and you like it but it feels like its just short of perfect then exchange it for another. You just might get one that works perfectly. 2) AVOID THE WHITE MODEL AT ALL COSTS. It changes to yellow after a few uses. Others have made the same comments. It seems to be an ongoing issue which reflects badly on this company that they would continue to distribute it. In any case, the white looks amazing but I am telling you... you need to avoid it anyway. It s really too bad because it was very sharp looking.

- Need a big grip? wanna free a USB port and connect via Bluetooth, wanna be able to add and edit features, customize buttons, look no more, this is it.

- The title says it all. My job software has a lot of drop down menus and boxes to click. The mouse is accurate and the click is soft and quiet. When your clicking a lot with a mouse that noise becomes very annoying.

- This mouse is the bee s knees. I d recommend this device 10/10.

- This mouse is like having three mice in one.  It has a preset button underneath it and allows you to change PCs at the touch of a button.  If desired, the mouse has a lot of configurable options via the Logitech software that you can download from their site for free.  It is not required for the mouse to work but it s there if you want to configure it to its fullest extent.

- The scroll wheel on this mouse is far and away the best I ve ever used, and I use the horizontal scroll wheel far more than i thought I would. My only complaints are there s not a spot to store the USB receiver in the mouse (not a huge deal since it can connect to 3 Bluetooth devices) and the mouse has no onboard memory. The lack of onboard memory is the bigger issue, as I can t install the Options+ app on my work PC, meaning I am unable to take full advantage of the mouse on the PC where the customizability would be most useful. But even without onboard memory this is my favorite mouse I ve used and I decided to keep it over the likes of the Logitech G604, Razer Basilisk, and JLab Epic Mouse.

- Mouse is great. Ergonomics are well designed and feel good. Connection is solid and fast (coming from usijg only gaming mice) but the issue is, the software slows the side scrolling down. Not sure why but when i delete the software the side scrolling returns to its smooth former self. With the software, side scrolling feels clunky and choppy. Such a bummer because you miss out on so many great perks of the software. Get the mouse, dont download the software.

- The best all-around mouse currently. Great for work, productivity, and just about everything. Not a top of the line mouse for gaming, but not bad. Overall, the best mouse on the market currently.

- Great Mouse. comfortable, fast and smooth. My only complain, if this counts as one, I will soon need to upgrade my current Logitech keyboard to one that accepts the Logi Bolt receiver. As of now those keyboards a very expensive.

- For context: I m 6 4, large hands, and I use claw grip.I love how this fits my hand even though I use claw grip.  The setup was fairly simple, I had a few questions but the  buddy  software it launches during setup helped a lot.  At base level this mouse is already awesome, but where it shines is the customization with the logitech software it launches, everything from custom button mapping, sensitivity, speed, gesture+button combinations - it s really great.  Switching between sources is seamless as well.  Definitely a great buy!

string(2128) "Take this list of reviews of a product: 

- Powerful vacuum. Easy to clean and accessories are helpful for various needs.

- After just over a year. Both of the rollers died. Hair gets caught inside the side with bearings. And it will put off a smell of burnt hair this is despite CONSTANTLY cleaning debris after every vacuum.

- How much time can this  vacuum  the Dyson V8 Animal cordless stick vacuum go before it runs out of power? I found it only lasted for one half hour.  Is this good or not so good?I like not having to move my cord from room to room. With having bad hands I can manage the handle .  I cannot recommend it to a friend yet until I use it more.The sale price at London Drugs was good so I purchased it from them.

- Works well but modest battery life. Takes slightly less than forever to recharge.

- I would highly recommend this product. It’s easy to use and lightweight.

- Amazing product.  Super light and easy to use.  Rarely have to drag out my full sized dyson to vacuum now.

- This is our second Dyson cordless. First one lasted 8 years. the new one is even better. Even bought one for our daughter. Makes doing the job so much easier. Don t even pull out our corded upright anymore. Can t remember life without one.

- Exactly as described! It works pretty good and it was super easy to set up

- Very nice basic pad for desk. You can probably get a more unique from amazon but i needed something plain for work. Protects desk from scratches and stains.

- Awesome gaming mouse pad for my son s computer desk.

- Excellent mouse pad. Fits under the computer, and ample room to use the mouse.

- Love this product. I was looking for something to lay down under my keyboard and mouse. This did it.

- This mouse pad was a gift and just what was needed. Doesn t slide but mouse glides over it effortlessly.

- Great addition to the home office set-up. Fits a full sized keyboard and mouse with room to spare

- This oversized mouse pad is great for my laptop and monitor set up. Give ample space and looks great on the desk.

- I needed a new desk mat and I purchased this. It’s a great desk mat but it’s a little to small for me.

- I love the fact that my keyboard stays foot  and plenty of room for the mouse.....

- It really ties the room together. I wish there were other color options, but gray works for me. I m thankful for the simple design.
