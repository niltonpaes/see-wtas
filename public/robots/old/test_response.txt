Initial tweet: 

O cancelamento da Feira Israelense na UNICAMP por conta de manifesta√ß√µes contr√°rias √© um epis√≥dio muito triste. Inviabilizaram um evento s√≥ pela participa√ß√£o de Israel. Isso √© inaceit√°vel. H√° muito tempo nossas Universidades deixaram de ser ambientes democr√°ticos.N√£o √© de hoje‚Ä¶ 

List of replies: 

- @KimKataguiri Se vc t√° triste eu t√¥ feliz

- @gatinncomunista @KimKataguiri E eu triste por voc√™ üòø

- @KimKataguiri Relaxe que o amor vence sempre ‚Ä¶ o amor venceu ü´∂Olha como eles s√£o tolerantes.. mas se fosse Cuba, Venezuela ‚Ä¶ Rapaz!!

- @KimKataguiri Enquanto n√£o judicializarem esses epis√≥dios, nada vai mudar

- @KimKataguiri Precisa ser judicializado, entrar com um processo contra a @ujcbr

- @KimKataguiri a gente sabe o tipo de democracia e liberdade que voc√™ quer, lembro bem do podcast

- @KimKataguiri Se a inten√ß√£o fosse boa iriam conseguir que o evento n√£o fosse realizado com argumento ou na justi√ßa, mas √© clara militancia por nada

- @KimKataguiri FALA SOBRE ISSO KIM!!!!üó£üó£üó£üó£üó£ https://t.co/7mF8XAoGI6

- @KimKataguiri Tem alguma explica√ß√£o  plaus√≠vel  para protestar contra a feira israelense?

- @KimKataguiri ü´£ https://t.co/MR3E0Ue3Xe

- @KimKataguiri A esquerda brasileira sempre escondeu seu √≥dio aos judeus com esse discurso antissionista for√ßado. Aceitar a exist√™ncia de um estado judeu √© inaceit√°vel pra essa gente.

- @KimKataguiri Epis√≥dio triste foi o bombardeio que Israel fez √† capital S√≠ria esta noite. Cad√™ aquela hist√≥ria de respeito ao territ√≥rio do outro pa√≠s, que vcs utilizam pra defender a ditadura nazista ucraniana?

- @KimKataguiri Nazismo do bem

- @KimKataguiri Kim queria mesmo √© ser um l√≠der de esquerda, mas l√°  coisa √© mais dif√≠cil, muita gente inteligente, √© mais f√°cil lidar com o gado alienado. Ent√£o ele vive no purgat√≥rio da direita, ora sendo um fascistas e hora sendo um cara s√©rio. O importante s√£o os votos

- @KimKataguiri Antissemitismo de esquerda √© equivalente ao amor.Esquerda sendo esquerda. https://t.co/qrq0zFUDE4

- @KimKataguiri Realmente, √© lament√°vel o antissemitismo velado disfar√ßado de academicismo que est√° em voga neste pa√≠s.

- @KimKataguiri Isso come√ßou a acontecer em 2016, com o advento de grupos como o MBL, que por fim resultaram no bolsonarismo.

- @KimKataguiri Lembro da reuni√µes do CA, as vota√ß√µes s√≥ eram feitas quando restava apenas o grupelho que j√° tinha escolhido o resultado. Isso h√° 25 anos.

- @KimKataguiri Dou gra√ßas a Deus por ter feito faculdade nos anos 90... N√£o aguentaria o ambiente acad√™mico t√≥xico de hoje.

- @KimKataguiri E chega de manifesta√ß√£o sem prop√≥sito real! Vejo muitos postarem e bradarem SALVE A AMAZ√îNIA, por exemplo, e n√£o se juntam e articulam algo para salvar a pracinha do bairro! Vamos fazer algo mais pr√≥ximo, e qdo tudo ao nosso redor estiver melhor, isso refletir√° no mais longe!

- @KimKataguiri O poder p√∫blico d√° respaldo a esses atos, ent√£o...

- @KimKataguiri Vai l√° cobrar, a gente sabe q geral l√° te ama.

- @KimKataguiri Nazistas na unicamp?

- @KimKataguiri N√£o foram apenas manifesta√ß√µes contr√°rias. Houve viol√™ncia.

- @KimKataguiri https://t.co/2P9RDWIO1A

- @KimKataguiri A√≠ ai

- @KimKataguiri N√£o s√£o manifestantes contr√°rios, s√£o radicais de extrema esquerda antissemitas A prud√™ncia no tratamento deste imbecis neste tipo de acontecimento ajudam que eles percebam a fraqueza e o medo. E os encorajam a atacar sem piedade ou receio
