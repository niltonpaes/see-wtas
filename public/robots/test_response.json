			"comment": "How much time can this  vacuum  the Dyson V8 Animal cordless stick vacuum go before it runs out of power? \nI found it only lasted for one half hour.  Is this good or not so good?\nI like not having to move my cord from room to room. With having bad hands I can manage the handle .  I cannot recommend it to a friend yet until I use it more.\nThe sale price at London Drugs was good so I purchased it from them.",
